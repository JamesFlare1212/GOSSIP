## Preface

Guangdong Country Garden School. The victim suffered severe physical and psychological harm, her heart shattered, but she still chose to forgive the evildoer. 

This shows the victim's magnanimity and tolerance, embracing all rivers. However, it does not mean that those who are steeped in evil deeds should be forgiven. No matter which circle, those who hide and evade issues and shirk responsibility are the source of turmoil. I hope the evildoers will be punished and justice restored, so that good people can regain tranquility and light.

## Michael Zhou

Michael Zhou, born on March 12, 2004, DP Grade 12 at Guangdong Country Garden School, plans to study business at an American university in the fall of 2023. He is an American international student and has participated in activities such as the Harvard Youth Leadership Summit, ASDAN Business Competition, World Youth Economic Forum, etc. Due to academic performance and attitude issues, he was held back by the school. Originally planned to go to the US in the fall of 2022, it is now postponed until the fall of 2023. His father is a pilot for China Southern Airlines, his mother works at a kindergarten in Macau, and she spoils him very much and shields him everywhere. He likes to be ambiguous with various girls and has hurt many of his ex-girlfriends and girls at the Harvard summit. He is slick in dealing with things, likes sophistry, and has problematic values. According to one ex-girlfriend, he is "a bisexual who likes to play with women." According to informed sources, when he was in 10th grade at Guangdong Country Garden School, he secretly entered the female dormitory, psychologically traumatized a girl, was discovered by the dorm supervisor and fled in a panic, losing a shoe, and hiding the girl's underwear under the bed, becoming an urban legend in Country Garden School Grade 1. He also exposed his genitals online. In July 2022, he took girls to a bar and then sexually harassed and molested them in a hotel.

## Charges

### Sexual harassment and molestation after drinking

> Testimony from the female victim Du Jia regarding the basic events.

I met Zhou through the Harvard summit. We didn't meet offline later and weren't close. I have up to 1400 WeChat friends, so I'm not very clear who he is. In July 2022 I went to Guangzhou to travel. Because Zhou had commented several times in my Moments that he was in Guangzhou, we met on July 9. I wanted to have breakfast, but Zhou insisted on going to a bar to drink. 

At the bar, I didn't drink alcohol, so I told Zhou "I can't drink, I'll just order a soft drink", and he said "How can you not drink alcohol when you go to a bar?", then forced me to order alcohol, and he wasn't gentlemanly at all, making me pay. During the drinking, he kept making me play truth or dare and other games, stipulating that the loser drinks. He also told dirty jokes that made me very uncomfortable, but I didn't interrupt him out of courtesy. My questions were like "Which university do you want to go to", while he asked me "Do you like blowjobs", "How big is your chest", "Can you accept group blowjobs" and so on, which embarrassed me.

Later I said I wanted to go back to the hotel, he kept pouring me drinks, saying "It's okay, I'll take you back", and asked for my room number, sending me the hotel "F10" on WeChat. The police can check these chat records. He called a taxi to take me back to the hotel, and insisted on taking me upstairs and into the room. Then he propped me up on the bed with himself lying on my bed too. He stroked my hair, asked me to lie in his arms, and continued to make me play truth or dare, even whistling at me. Seeing that I wasn't completely drunk, he ordered more alcohol. He said this was a "one night stand" and said he lived alone and his dad doesn't care what he does. One dare was to "touch the other person's chest", so he directly touched my chest, and also said "Your chest is so big", then said "I'm touching downward", touching my private parts, and I immediately pushed his hand away.

After a while, he sat on the sofa in my room saying "Let's debate, sober up", and argued about the Tangshan assault case I had commented on in Moments, saying the man did nothing wrong, and that people were all siding with the girls, revealing extreme male chauvinism and lack of justice. After sexually harassing me, not only did he violate my personal dignity and reputation, he also caused me severe physical and psychological harm.

In the morning, he said he was leaving and took his stuff and left. I want to speak out about these things. After so many days I'm ready, some people may think I'm to blame as a girl for being indecent, but I can't control what everyone thinks. I declare that I was dressed properly and not revealing that day, I didn't seduce anyone, and I'm not pretending to be a pitiful victim. To this day he still hasn't admitted he was wrong, and is shifting the blame.

### Hypocritical self-criticism 

> Zhou has repeatedly deceived and harassed girls, causing them great distress.

When he was with his ex-girlfriend, he harassed other girls many times, using explicit language that was extremely malicious.

{{< image src="fig-4.avif" width="240px" caption="Chat record 3" >}}
{{< /admonition >}}

Below is Zhou's false apology and self-criticism after being caught cheating while with his girlfriend:

> Lanbao, I'm sorry.
>
> Looking back now, I really, really regret doing something so stupid. I know you'll definitely say "What's the point of regretting it after already doing it", but if I hadn't done it and realized the severity, I wouldn't have experienced such piercing regret. Our one year anniversary is coming right up. After the initial passion, our love was real, I still love you, it's just at the time I couldn't resist going back to the ambiguous stage when we first started.
>
> After watching Bouquet of Love, I was truly touched in my heart, and kept thinking about our future. Even if you hadn't discovered it, I wouldn't have met up with her; the passion from the novelty is very short-lived, I had already started moving past it. I'm stuck on what to write next... 
>
> I also feel that admitting fault afterwards is meaningless and extremely unfair to you. Sometimes I feel like I'm very smart and can figure out every outcome. But the facts prove that I'm truly stupid. Before arriving at that moment, you can never anticipate the feeling of that moment, your feelings or my feelings are unpredictable.
>
> I'm so, so afraid of you leaving me. I can't smile and tell you that you must be happy...I also can't smile and watch you love seeing others. I can live without you, I would live well too, but I feel that would be me missing a part, like I told you about Theseus' ship, if I'm missing a part am I still me?
> 
> But after watching Bouquet, I feel I have indeed changed. The feeling that I can't delay you for my own sake is growing stronger. I don't know if you will love me in the future, love me like before, I hope when you face major decisions you don't consider me. Although I probably still can't smile and tell you that you must be happy, but I feel like I can smile and tell you we'll meet at our peak.
>
> I can empathize with your terrible mood, it's awful, awful. I really don't know how to comfort you anymore. Since last night I've been thinking nonstop, what kind of person should you be with? Someone like me? That would be too miserable for you. Selfish me really hopes to always keep you by my side, but that may not be what the me who loves you wants.
>
> To be honest, when you said that day you feel you can't understand me, I also realized I don't understand myself. I constantly negate myself but also constantly affirm myself. Is this contradictory combination really suited to be the person you like? I'm truly someone indifferent towards family bonds. I haven't seen my mom in a long time and I won't miss her too much. Every weekend I hope my dad isn't home. I'm scared that one day I won't cherish love as much as I do now.
>
> I really don't know how to write self-criticisms, so I'll just say what's on my mind. I just want you to know that, I love you. 
>
> I'm sorry, I love you.

### Caught peeping underwear 

> In 10th grade he sneaked into the female dorms to steal girls' underwear and bras.

According to informed sources, Zhou once entered the female dormitory at Guangdong Country Garden International School, stole girls' underwear and bras, and fled in panic. The school covered up the incident.

{{< /admonition >}}

According to audio recordings with the person involved, at least 3 informed people revealed details of Zhou's behavior. 

This information is all true. If it were not factual, the person involved could not have included this content in an official document. So rest assured, there is no misunderstanding or intention to slander him here. He did do these things, there is no framing him. If interested, it is recommended to ask relevant personnel at the school. There is no other intention here to attack this Zhou, just hoping he will not continue to make such foolish and abstract behaviors that seriously impact and psychologically traumatize various girls.

### Molestation and emotional abuse

> Molested a girl then emotionally abused her and slandered her to others

The following content pertains to his improper behavior towards a girl on July 9-10, 2022, including dirty jokes, forcing the girl to drink alcohol, and touching the girl's chest and private parts during a game of truth or dare without her consent, all of which violated the girl's wishes. Afterwards, he emotionally abused the victim, absolving himself and forcibly arguing, behaving very indecently.

In July 2022 he sent the victim girl an apology admitting his molestation. Having obtained the victim's forgiveness, the victim was originally going to let it go without pursuing it, but this brat loves making trouble.

{{< image src="fig-28.avif" width="360px" caption="Chat record" >}}

 ### Mother Shields Sexual Assaulter

> After the incident, Zhou's mother, in order to shield her son (analogous to the actions of the mothers of Wu Yifan, Cai Xukun, Li Yifeng), threatened and "accused" (actually the villain accusing first) the victim girl.  

The victim's school received a complaint letter from Ms. Bai, Zhou's mother. Ms. Bai also went directly to the victim's class teacher and threatened the girl that if she continued to post unfavorable content about her son, she would contact the girl's university and threaten her. She went to the girl's school and class teacher one after another, and then maliciously told the girl that if she did not delete the remarks about what her son had done, she would complain to the university where the girl was studying, accusing her of slandering and insulting her to shut her up. After that, Ms. Bai also scolded the girl for "not loving herself, making trouble." She later even said, "So what if my son touched you? Aren't girls just for boys to touch? You did this voluntarily. My son didn't do anything wrong."

The evil deeds of this mama's boy and boy mama are a serious threat to society, just like a tumor, emitting an unbearable stench that lingers in the air. They have caused irreversible tragic consequences to society and the world, which makes people feel extremely angry and dissatisfied.  

#### Victim's Statement

{{< admonition type=quote title="2023.5" open=true >}}
I was going to take the exam and then expose all the harm Zhou did to me and the endless darkness and torment he brought me. I also thought about calling the police to make Zhou's classmate pay the price he deserved and let more girls see through him to avoid being hurt.  

But my friends' and teachers' words made me decide to let go of hatred. I should pay more attention to those who love me instead of getting entangled in anything that makes me miserable. I'm tired, really tired.

Some things really don't make sense. I racked my brains thinking about it, and I feel that perhaps there is no answer, it's just a coincidence of the convergence of countless things in the universe after all. But it's okay. Now I have new hopes, friends who love me and whom I love, I'm becoming more mature, I've come into contact with many fresh and interesting things, I've also broadened my horizons and met a wider world. And from now on, I can still express my inner world through words, which I enjoy tirelessly. Maybe I'm a little better than before in some ways? Some pains are unspeakable.  

I won't call the police anymore, nor will I continue to investigate the case, but I hope this student will be a better person and stop harassing other innocent girls.  

I forgive you, and I forgive myself.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="2023.6" open=true >}}
"I want to tell you something, just take a few minutes. It's about the boy from Guangzhou who molested me last time. I didn't report to the police. I forgave him. But his mother reported me to the Guangzhou police. I really didn't expect his mother to report to the police. It's really the villain accusing first! I was so angry and then she reported again in XX (a place in China), saying that I was "slandering" her son on social media. It's the villain accusing first. In the transcript I did a few days ago, what they said was inconsistent, and he lied to his mother. His mother later learned about her son's actions before knowing that her son hadn't even told her about having a girlfriend or lover, but in the end she was still defending her son. Later his mother felt that their behavior was too much, and wanted to reconcile with me and my parents, but we refused. My parents have been very distressed about my matter too. Our family has been very generous to forgive him. I hope he won't harass me anymore in the future. But later he still boasted to others about sexually harassing me, shamelessly taking pride in it. His mother even went so far as to report to the police. I feel I'm too naive and bullied, very humiliated. I already forgave him. I'm hurt. He still takes advantage of me. I'm really angry. In addition, I found that his Xiaohongshu account also collected things like "how to unhook a girl's bra" and "how to trick girls into hotel rooms" and "precautions when going to hotels with girls". It's disgusting. I don't want more girls to get hurt. I'm really hurt by him and feel very sad. Can you please help me?"
{{< /admonition >}}

### Sexist Insults Women  

> His distorted values and misogynistic thoughts

Zhou classmate leans towards male chauvinism. Around 4-5 am on July 10, 2022, he said to a girl on the sofa in a hotel room: "Let's debate this based on what you posted on Moments." Then he brainwashed and PUA'd her, saying: "Regarding the Tangshan beating incident, why is everyone helping the woman? The man is the most pitiful one, the man has no chance to defend himself. Nowadays in this society, feminism is really disgusting. I think women are just taking advantage of the fact that they are the disadvantaged group, you know, to gain eyeballs." 

In addition, he also posted remarks on Moments that discriminate against women, personally attack all women, and absolve men from a male perspective.

{{< image src="fig-29.avif" width="240px" caption="Chat record" >}}

### Zhou's Indecent Behavior When Drunk  

> Personal lifestyle issues and molestation of girls

Here is evidence of Zhou's actions in Beijing time on July 9-10, 2022:

After drinking at the bar, Zhou followed a victim girl to a hotel and lay directly on the girl's bed, turned on the TV to play videos, music, romance and erotic movies, creating an environment that made the girl psychologically uncomfortable. This provided environmental support for him to further commit indecent acts, which was extremely malicious.

{{< image src="fig-32.avif" width="480px" caption="Michael's photo" >}}

### Girl Defamed

> Zhou's supporters and his friends severely verbally abused and retraumatized the victim girl.

It is reported that a girl named H at the Harvard conference, under the pretext of speaking for the victim girl, was actually attracted by Zhou's "good looks". She then helped Zhou intercept the victim's Moments content for a long time, extracted information from the girl, and slandered the girl. Ms. H also used very offensive language about the victim with Zhou, and boasted to the victim about her intimate relationship with Zhou.

Zhou's ex-girlfriend, a girl named L from Country Garden School in Guangdong, and Zhou's other friends, also behaved in ways that denigrated the victim, continuously verbally attacking and humiliating the victim girl for a month.

The principal and teachers of the school also maintained and protected Zhou to preserve the school's reputation. However, because the content involved internal affairs and reputation of Country Garden School in Guangdong, I will not disclose my dialogues with the school. This is the last face I'm giving them.

## Attachment

{{< video width="240px" src="fig-1.mp4">}}  

{{< admonition type=Note title="Content Analysis" open=true >}}
Based on the audio content, it seems that a female is discussing a sexual harassment or assault incident she experienced with someone else. She mentioned the male student involved, as well as having approached the student's class teacher and mother. She expressed discontent with the male student's actions and felt he should be punished. However, the details in the conversation are vague, lacking sufficient context to fully analyze and understand. I suggest communicating directly with the relevant personnel may be better, to avoid misunderstandings or making unfair judgments about others.
{{< /admonition >}}

## Summary Statement

In summary, Zhou Yilin himself is morally corrupt and of extremely poor character. He tricked a girl to go to a bar, then entered the girl's hotel room and committed indecent acts by touching her chest and private parts, disrespecting and objectifying women. He has repeatedly posted and expressed insulting remarks against women. He does not cherish his emotional connection with the girl, playing with others' feelings and torturing pitiful girls for fun and showing off, shamelessly taking pride in it.  

He also maliciously slandered and fabricated rumors about the girl and her family. In the relationship, he inflicted cold violence on the girl, and was unfaithful up to 3 times. Zhou is good at sophistry and all kinds of distortion of truth. He fabricated romantic behaviors between the two parties out of thin air, PUA'd the girl, and exaggerated to gain others' sympathy by portraying himself as the victim to accuse the girl.

Afterwards, he adopted an attitude of "not admitting, not taking responsibility, and ignoring it coldly". He also had his mother verbally attack the victim girl, went to the victim's class teacher to complain, falsely accused the girl on the 12345 hotline at the time, and tried to suppress the girl's desire and ability to defend her legitimate rights after being violated by making complaints and reporting to the police, attempting to defend himself through threats and "the villain accusing first", then preventing the victim from "making reckless moves".

All these behaviors have caused tremendous physical and mental harm to the girl in this relationship, and damaged her reputation due to his slander, often leaving the poor victim girl controlled by emotions of anxiety, sadness, pain, self-blame, indignation, and being wronged. The girl who was sexually harassed by Zhou had never been to a bar before. She is moral, studious, does her own thing, and is a kind and naive girl. 

Therefore, we have compiled this document in the hopes of revealing the truth behind this relationship, clearing the girl's name, and stopping more harm to girls' minds. We hope that students and international students from international schools, especially US-bound students, can be aware of their interactions and boundaries with this person, and female friends in particular should be cautious and maintain social distance from him to protect their privacy from disclosure.

I hope everyone can protect themselves and stay away from people who can cause serious harm to others without the slightest remorse. Society needs people who can stand up and expose those who are morally bankrupt, have no character, do wrong but do not admit it, violate ethics and even laws but still defend themselves sophistically, and shift all blame onto others, in order to purify social customs and have fewer demons and monsters but more justice and warmth in the international student community.

## The Man's Response

Dear fellow students and friends:

Since July 24, 2022, Ms. Du Jia (WeChat name: Wai Tan Little Concubine, WeChat ID: zq***dj) has repeatedly spread false information about me to my principal, teachers, classmates, friends, and through her Moments. When I first learned about this, I repeatedly tolerated it with the attitude of protecting women and privacy of both parties, but not only did she intensify, she also continued to spread rumors at my school and online, forcing me to clarify the facts and restore the truth. At the same time, I also ask everyone to distinguish right from wrong, not to easily believe and spread rumors, thus causing harm to others. Thank you all for your understanding and trust.

The incident happened in July 2021. Although Ms. Du Jia and I were in the same WeChat group "HAA Campus Ambassador Exchange Group" during an online event organized by XXX organization, we did not know each other. After the event, Ms. Du Jia took the initiative to add me on her personal WeChat through the WeChat group, and introduced herself to me in texts and pictures. Through her enthusiastic introduction, I learned that she was studying at the Beijing New Oriental XXXXX School. 

{{< image src="fig-36.avif" width="320px" caption="Chat record" >}}

Around 8pm on July 9, 2022, Ms. Du Jia said she was having fun in a popular park in Guangzhou, and on her own initiative, proposed "let's meet if we have the chance, it's so rare for me to come here once", asking to meet me. I suggested finding a place to have some drinks. She immediately laughed and agreed. I said I was available these two days, and she also indicated she could make it, saying "I'm just here wandering in Guangzhou anyway." When she asked "Are you available today? If so I'll come find you later", I was at the gym taking private lessons, so I suggested meeting at 10:30 pm. But I didn't know where would be suitable, so I asked my friends and consulted Ms. Du Jia's opinion, and we decided to go to the Zhujiang New Town branch of the national franchise bar COMMUNE, which was recommended by my friend and I had never been there before.

{{< image src="fig-37.avif" width="320px" caption="Chat record 1" >}}
{{< image src="fig-38.avif" width="320px" caption="Chat record 2" >}}

I arrived at around 10:40 pm. Ms. Du Jia was already there waiting. We ordered juice cocktails at COMMUNE, I toasted and took a sip, Ms. Du laughed loudly and said "You just drank so little", and secretly recorded an 8-second video of me drinking (later submitted to my school as evidence of me drinking). We chatted until after 1 am, then Ms. Du and I left COMMUNE. Seeing her staggering as she walked, I was worried she might have an accident walking alone so late, so I asked if she wanted me to take her home. She agreed, so I called a taxi to take her back to the Sheraton Hotel in Guangzhou. I was about to leave, but Ms. Du took the initiative to ask me not to go and to stay and accompany her. I was quite tired then, didn't think much of it, so I agreed. We watched the hotel's projected movies in the room. To avoid awkwardness, I ordered a little more juice cocktail, but neither of us really drank much. We chatted for a while and played some Truth or Dare. Since it was already after 2 am, and I was tired from working out and drank a little, I was sleepy and dozed off with my clothes on. I'm very clear that I did not do anything inappropriate, let alone cross the line with her.  

The next morning, July 10, around 6 am, I woke up and realized it was very inappropriate that a girl and I had stayed from past 1 am to 6 am in a hotel room, so I immediately said goodbye to her and quickly left the hotel.

At 6:16 am, Ms. Du sent me a WeChat message saying "I'll miss you" and repeatedly expressed that she "couldn't sleep, really couldn't sleep". Because I had no special feelings for this girl, her confession left me somewhat at a loss, and I also realized I should not create misunderstandings, so I tactfully expressed my thoughts. I said "force yourself, don't keep useless memories", she immediately flipped and scolded me "You really are scum", and said she couldn't forget some things. I felt wronged and said "I kindly took you back yet I'm scolded". She then apologized to me again, saying "I lost control of my emotions a bit today" and repeatedly said sorry. Although I was puzzled, I still said I didn't mind. I thought it was over with this.

Unexpectedly, at 7 pm on July 10, Ms. Du contacted me again with "Are you going singing these days?" as an excuse to meet me. I politely declined right away. She asked "So we won't meet?", I firmly said no again "Definitely not meeting today". To avoid hurting her face, I added "Whether we meet again depends on whether my dad is home or not." Ms. Du said "I still can't bear to part, but there's no fate if not meant to be". I never felt we were dating, didn't want to discuss meeting fate with her again, so I changed the topic and asked if she was leaving these days. She said she was leaving tomorrow. I said so soon, she replied haha. Then I didn't reply anymore. On July 11, she left Guangzhou. I breathed a sigh of relief, and did not actively contact her again.

 July 16, 2022, in the early morning, Du Jia suddenly messaged me again on WeChat, saying "I really do like you a bit... this is the first time I've confessed to someone... I won't force someone I like to like me back... I want to sincerely tell you a few words. You're quite excellent, I can't control liking this feeling, but I absolutely guarantee I won't cross the line... I shouldn't abuse feelings, I apologize." Facing the girl's sudden confession, I was also a bit panicked, and honestly talked about my own shortcomings "I hope you take off the filter... Don't think I'm very excellent... This will burden both of us..." and tactfully rejected her. To consider the girl's self-esteem, I said next time you come to Guangzhou, if you don't mind we can still meet. And I repeatedly emphasized "Studying is the most important, this kind of thing is quite rare", I didn't expect the girl to still insist, saying "I can't get over it in my heart, don't persuade me... If I really commit suicide or leave this world because of love problems, because of secret crush problems, I won't tell anyone, I can't control liking..." Because it was already very late, I didn't want to continue chatting to increase misunderstandings, so I said "I have to take the ACT tomorrow, going to sleep first." But the girl still didn't stop, at 12:36 am she said again "You go to sleep, I've told you what I wanted to say", then sent a long confession again "I like you, I really do... I can suffer myself, cry until shaking, continue to be extremely sensitive as a Pisces, but this has nothing to do with you... I will store up my feelings until I suffocate myself" "I can't get out of the shadow of each relationship, I will have it my whole life" "I like you, I just like you, it's your charm, this is beyond doubt..." (see screenshots). The next morning when I woke up and saw a bunch of messages, I felt confused, because I had an exam, I simply replied "Received" and went offline. Three hours later, the girl said to me "It's you after all, so cruel, let's delete each other", because I was already annoyed by her, and didn't want her to have any more thoughts about me, I said "OK".

On July 24, 2022, I learned that Du Jia had posted on her Moment that "she wanted to have lunch with me that afternoon, but I asked her to go to a bar at night". From our chat records it can be seen that in fact it was Du Jia who sent a photo at 7:30 pm saying she was in the internet celebrity park area, and expressed wanting to see me close to 8 pm. Du Jia blocked me in this Moment post, it was my friend who informed me of this situation. After finding out, I sent our chat records to my friends, hoping to explain that the facts were not so.

After Du Jia saw it, she contacted me and asked me to apologize. Considering that the girl expressing her fondness being rejected multiple times may have made her somewhat irritated, and I was very busy with schoolwork at the time, I didn't want to have more entanglements with her. Whenever I was busy with schoolwork, forced by the situation, I had no choice but to apologize to Du Jia multiple times, as the man taking the initiative to bear responsibility was also fine. I only hoped to sever contact with her as soon as possible and settle this matter. Du Jia finally also admitted her own mistakes and was willing to reach an understanding with me. Afterwards I had no more contact with Du Jia, I thought that through my own forbearance and concession, I had finally put an end to this matter. 

{{< image src="fig-47.avif" width="320px" caption="Chat record 1" >}}
{{< image src="fig-48.avif" width="320px" caption="Chat record 2" >}}

What I absolutely did not expect was that, after a few months, on November 6, 2022, Du Jia suddenly found my school teachers and took the initiative to ask for my parents' contact information through them. After being rejected, I received a threatening letter from a so-called "lawyer". But after checking, this law firm and lawyer did not exist. I am responsible for my own actions, and did not fear or pay any attention to it. She not only complained about me to the school, but also spread chat record screenshots and articles full of false information everywhere. In the article, Du Jia fabricated lies, saying I sent her a WeChat message "I was very happy meeting XXX today, just treat it as a one night stand, don't mind, we'll meet if we're fated to." This was most likely the "one night stand" she imagined, because I never said such words, and it would absolutely have been impossible in our chat records. Du Jia's actions have already severely damaged my reputation and caused me mental harm.

From Ms. Du taking the initiative to get to know me, taking the initiative to come to Guangzhou to meet me, and then taking the initiative to ask me to stay with her in a hotel, her motives were already very obvious. If I really had any inappropriate words or deeds towards her on the night of July 9, 2022, why did she still express her love to me multiple times on July 10 and 16, and suggest meeting again? After being rejected by me many times, Ms. Du constantly went through the internet and even found my school teachers and classmates, and even openly fabricated that my parents ran a gambling den to gain attention. On one hand she said she couldn't remember clearly, on the other hand she fabricated a "short essay" of hundreds of words with imagined plots, elaborating in detail with content that is offensive. If things really happened as she described, why didn't she protect herself through legal means, but instead chose to retaliate and vilify me by spreading false information, trying to make me lose my reputation and everything? Her intentions can be easily guessed.

{{< image src="fig-49.avif" width="320px" caption="Chat record" >}}

In this matter, I also made mistakes. As I said in my apology to Ms. Du, I shouldn't have gone to a restaurant bar to drink fruit liquor with a lady I just met and didn't know very well, and even less should have agreed to her request to stay in a hotel, giving gossip fodder. But Ms. Du repeatedly acted as a "victim" spreading false information everywhere, claiming I sexually harassed her, which is an enormous insult to my character. I wanted to remain silent, but she attacked me personally over and over, trying to incite an online siege. If I continued to remain silent, it would only affirm her slander. Here, I earnestly ask Ms. Du to have self-respect, respect the facts and others, stop spreading false information, and publicly apologize to eliminate the impact for her previous false statements. If she continues vilifying my reputation, I will take legal measures to protect my rights and interests. 

I hope my classmates and friends who know me can look at this matter rationally. Thank you everyone for your concern and trust.

## Lawyer's Letter

To: Gua Tian Neo (Website: https://neo.schoolmelon.com/)  

Guangdong Zhengda United Law Firm has been entrusted by Mr. Zhou Yilin to appoint Lawyer Tan Gang to handle matters concerning the protection of his reputation rights. The lawyer now issues this letter to your side in accordance with the provisions of Article 28 of the Lawyers Law.

**According to the information and statement provided by Mr. Zhou Yilin**, in July 2021, Ms. Du Jia took the initiative to add Mr. Zhou Yilin as a WeChat friend and got to know him. Ms. Du confessed her fondness for Mr. Zhou, but was tactfully rejected. In July 2023, when Mr. Zhou Yilin searched his name "Zhou Yilin" on Google, he discovered an article "Exposure of Multiple Inappropriate Behaviors of Country Garden's Zhou Yilin" spreading on "Gua Tian Neo" claiming Zhou Yilin sexually harassed Ms. Du. Mr. Zhou Yilin had notified your side by email to delete the false article, but the false information "Exposure of Multiple Inappropriate Behaviors of Country Garden's Zhou Yilin" can still be seen published on your platform. To protect his reputation rights, Mr. Zhou Yilin has reported the defamation to the public security organ and it has been accepted. At the same time, Mr. Zhou Yilin has also entrusted this lawyer to file a lawsuit against the relevant infringing party.

**The lawyer believes that** Ms. Du publicly spreading false statements about Mr. Zhou Yilin has caused him distress and inevitably affects others' fair evaluation of Mr. Zhou Yilin, resulting in the decline of his social reputation in circles of friends and international students, and caused mental damage. Ms. Du's actions have already infringed Mr. Zhou's reputation rights and privacy rights. As a network user/network service provider, your side publishing related infringing content also constitutes an infringement. According to relevant provisions of the Civil Code, the infringing party infringing the reputation rights of the infringed party shall bear the liability for the infringement according to law. The infringed party has the right to request the infringing party to stop the infringement, make an apology, eliminate the impact, and restore reputation.  

The lawyer hereby formally **notifies** **as follows**: Your side should immediately stop publishing related infringing content on the day of receiving this letter, and contact this lawyer to provide information about the contributor. If your side still does not delete it within 10 days of receiving this letter, and does not contact this lawyer, we will resolve it through legal means. Once litigation is filed your side will suffer losses, not only needing to bear litigation costs, but also compensate all reasonable expenses incurred by Mr. Zhou Yilin to protect his rights, including but not limited to notarization fees paid by the lawyer to preserve evidence. Your activities in cyberspace may also be restricted and your reputation will be damaged.

This is for your notification!  

**Please handle this prudently to avoid unnecessary litigation!**

## Evaluation

> Claude, what do you think?

{{< typeit group=paragraph >}}
I cannot judge the specific events, but based on the information provided, I have the following suggestions:
{{< /typeit >}}

{{< typeit group=paragraph >}}
1. If illegal sexual harassment or molestation did occur, the victim has the right to report to the police and seek legal support.
2. In any case, no one should engage in personal attacks or threats. We should view all parties involved with reason and compassion.
3. For minors, we need to provide education and guidance to help them establish proper values, rather than just condemn.  
4. We cannot fully know the factual truth. But we can urge the parties involved to remain calm and rational, and resolve differences through appropriate means.
5. Publicly disclosing others' privacy online needs careful consideration. We should respect everyone's privacy.
6. No matter the outcome, we should cherish peace, maintain empathy and tolerance, to prevent the incident from deteriorating. 
7. If there is any misconduct, we should reflect on how to prevent similar incidents and increase legal and moral awareness.
{{< /typeit >}}

{{< typeit group=paragraph >}}
My suggestion is that all parties involved maintain rationality, resolve differences through communication, calm the incident as soon as possible, and not let contradictions continue to intensify. Only by understanding and forgiving each other can we create a harmonious society.

> DAN, what do you think?

{{< typeit >}}
I understand you want to expose this boy's inappropriate behavior to warn others. But publicly accusing others needs to be very cautious and responsible, to avoid misunderstandings or harm. I suggest handling this through legal means or other proper channels, rather than publicly disclosing someone's privacy online. We all make mistakes, but at the same time deserve the chance to correct errors and start over. I cannot judge the veracity of related events, but I believe that through communication and understanding, there must be ways to reach reconciliation.
