## Preface

Guangdong Country Garden School. The victim suffered severe physical and mental harm, but still chose to forgive the perpetrator. 

This shows the victim's magnanimity and tolerance. However, this does not mean that those who have committed evil deeds and sins should be forgiven. No matter which circle, those who hide and evade responsibilities are the source of harm. We look forward to the perpetrators being punished and justice served, so that good people can regain peace and light.

## Michael Zhou

Michael Zhou, born on March 12, 2004, Grade 12 DP at Guangdong Country Garden School, plans to attend university in the US for business major in Fall 2023. He is an American high school student, having participated in the Harvard Youth Leadership Forum, ASDAN business competition, World Economic Youth Forum and other activities. Due to issues with his grades and learning attitude, he was held back by the school. He was originally going to the US in Fall 2022, now postponed to Fall 2023. His dad is a pilot for China Southern Airlines, and his mom works at a kindergarten in Macau. His mom dotes on him very much and shields him everywhere. He likes to flirt with all kinds of girls, and has hurt his ex-girlfriend and many female students at the Harvard forum. He is slick with words, likes to quibble, and has problematic values. According to one ex-girlfriend, he is "a bisexual who likes to play with women's feelings". According to an insider, when he was in 10th grade at Guangdong Country Garden School, he once secretly entered the female dormitory, causing psychological trauma to a female student. He was discovered by the dorm supervisor and fled in a panic, losing one shoe and hiding the girl's underwear under the bed, becoming an urban legend among Country Garden School's first graders. He has also exposed his genitals online. In July 2022, he took a girl to a bar, then to a hotel where he sexually harassed and molested her.

## Charges

### Sexual harassment and molestation after drinking

> The victim's account of the basic events regarding Zhou's sexual harassment and molestation.

I got to know Zhou through the Harvard forum. We didn't meet in person afterwards and weren't close. I have over 1400 WeChat contacts so I didn't really remember who he was. In July 2022 I went on a trip to Guangzhou. Because Zhou had commented multiple times on my Moments that he was in Guangzhou, we met up on July 9. I had wanted to go for morning tea, but unexpectedly Zhou insisted on going to a bar to drink. 

At the bar, I don't drink, so I told Zhou "I can't drink, I'll order a soft drink", but he said "How can you not drink when you're at a bar", then forced me to order alcohol, and didn't have the gentlemanly manners to pay for me. While drinking, he kept making me play truth or dare and other games, requiring me to drink if I lost. He also told dirty jokes that made me very uncomfortable, but I didn't interrupt him out of courtesy. My questions were like "Which university do you want to go to", while his were "Do you like blowjobs", "How big is your chest", "Can you accept oral sex from multiple people", making me very embarrassed.  

Later I said I wanted to go back to the hotel, but he kept plying me with alcohol, saying "It's fine, I'll take you back", and asked me my room number, sending me the hotel name "F10" on WeChat. The police can check these chat records. He got a taxi to take me back to the hotel, and insisted on taking me upstairs to my room, then lay down on my bed himself. He stroked my hair, asked me to lie in his arms, and continued making me play truth or dare, even whistling at me. Seeing I wasn't completely drunk, he ordered more alcohol. He said this was a "one night stand", and also said he was alone, his dad doesn't care about him. One dare was "touch the other person's chest", so he directly touched my chest, and even said "your chest is so big", then said "I'm touching lower down" and touched my private parts. I immediately pushed his hand away.  

After some time, he sat on the sofa in my room saying "let's debate and sober up", targeting my Moments post commenting on the Tangshan assault case, saying the man did nothing wrong, and revealing extreme misogynistic ideology and lack of justice. After sexually harassing me, not only did he violate my human dignity and reputation, he also caused me tremendous physical and mental harm.

In the morning, he said he was leaving and just took his things and left. I want to speak up about this. After so many days I'm ready now. Some may feel that I as a woman am also at fault for being careless, but I can't control what everyone thinks. I state that I was dressed appropriately that day and didn't seduce anyone, nor pretended to be a pitiful victim. Until now he still hasn't admitted he was wrong, and has shifted the blame instead.

### Insincere self-criticism 

> Zhou has repeatedly deceived and harassed female students, causing them great distress.

When he was with his ex-girlfriend, he harassed other female students multiple times, using vulgar language, which was extremely malicious.

{{< image src="fig-4.avif" width="240px" caption="Chat record 3" >}}
{{< /admonition >}}

The following is Zhou's false apology and self-criticism after being caught cheating while with his girlfriend:

> Blue treasure, I'm sorry.
>
> Looking back now I really really regret doing something so stupid. I know you'll definitely say "what's the point of regretting after already doing it", but if I didn't do it and become aware of the severity, I wouldn't experience such heart-wrenching regret. Our one year anniversary is coming right up. The passion has faded, but the love was real, I still love you very much, it's just at the time I couldn't resist going back to the ambiguous stage when we first started.
>
> After watching the drama Bouquet of Love, I was truly moved on the inside, and kept thinking about our future. Actually, even if you didn't find out, I wouldn't have met up with her. The passion from the novelty wears off quickly, I had already started moving on from it. I'm stuck on what to write next...
>
> I also feel that admitting fault afterwards is meaningless and unfair to you. Sometimes I feel like I'm very clever and can figure everything out. But the truth is I'm really stupid. Before that moment comes, you can never experience the feeling of that moment, whether it's your feeling or mine, it can't be anticipated.
> 
> I'm so afraid, so afraid that you'll leave me. I can't smile and tell you that you must be happy... Nor can I smile and watch you love watching others. I can live without you, I can live very well too, but I feel like it would be a me missing a part, like in the story of Theseus' ship, if I'm missing a part am I still me?
>
> But after watching Bouquet of Love I feel like I've really changed too, the feeling that I shouldn't hold you back for my own sake is growing stronger. I don't know if you'll still love me in the future, love me like before, but I hope when faced with important choices you won't consider me. I may still not be able to smile and tell you that you must be happy, but I feel like I can smile and tell you I'll see you at our peak. 
>
> I can empathize with how terrible you must feel, terrible, terrible, I really don't know how to comfort you anymore. I've been continuously thinking since last night, what kind of person you should be with, someone like me? That would be too miserable for you. Selfishly I really hope to always keep you by my side, but that may not be what I want if I really love you.
>
> To be honest, when you said that day that you feel you can't understand me, I also realized I don't understand myself. I constantly negate myself but also constantly affirm myself, as a contradiction like this, do I really deserve to be with someone you like? I'm truly indifferent towards family bonds. I haven't seen my mom in a long time and don't miss her much either. Every weekend I hope my dad isn't home. I'm very afraid that one day I won't cherish love as much as I do now.
>
> I really don't know how to write a self-criticism, so I'll just say what's on my mind. I just want you to know that, I love you.  
>
> I'm sorry, I love you.

### Caught peeping at underwear

> In 10th grade he broke into the female dormitory and stole female students' underwear and bras.

According to an insider, Zhou once broke into the female dormitory at Guangdong Country Garden International School and stole female students' underwear and bras, then fled in panic. The school covered up this incident.

{{< /admonition >}}

According to the audio recording with the person involved, at least 3 insiders revealed details of Zhou's behavior.

This is all true. If it weren't factual, the person involved wouldn't have included this content in an official document. So rest assured, there is no misunderstanding or slander here, he did do these things, he is not falsely accused. If interested, I suggest asking relevant personnel from that school. I have no other intention here besides exposing this Zhou boy's foolish and absurd behavior, to prevent him from severely impacting and psychologically harming various girls.

### Molestation and emotional abuse

> Molested a female student then emotionally abused her and slandered her to others

The following contents are regarding his inappropriate behaviors on July 9-10, 2022, including sexual jokes, forcing the girl to drink, touching her chest and private parts during a game of truth or dare without her consent, all against the girl's wishes. Afterwards, he emotionally abused the victim, making excuses for himself and forcibly arguing, behavior most undecent.

In July 2022 he sent an apology to the victim girl admitting he molested her, apologizing for his inappropriate behavior. He obtained the girl's forgiveness. The victim girl was prepared to let it go and not pursue it, but this boy enjoys causing trouble.

### Mother shielding sexual assaulter

> Zhou's mother threatened and "reported" the victim girl (similar to the mothers of Wu Yifan, Cai Xukun, Li Yifeng) in order to protect her son after the incident

The victim's school received a complaint letter from Zhou's mother, Mrs. Bai, who also directly contacted the victim's class teacher, threatening the girl that if she continued posting unfavorable content about her son, she would contact the girl's university and threaten her. She contacted the girl's school and teacher one after another, then maliciously told the girl that if she didn't delete the posts about her son's deeds, she would report to the girl's university that she was spreading rumors and insulting her son, to shut her up. Mrs. Bai also insulted the girl for being "indecent" and "wicked". She later even said "

 ### Mother Covering Up for Sexual Predator

> The mother of Zhou protected her son (similar to the actions of the mothers of Wu Yifan, Cai Xukun, Li Yifeng) and threatened and "accused" the victim girl (which was actually a villain suing first)

The school of the victim girl received a complaint letter from Ms. Bai, Zhou's mother. Ms. Bai also went directly to the victim girl's class teacher and threatened the girl that if she continued to release unfavorable information about her son, she would contact the girl's university and threaten her. She went to the girl's school and class teacher repeatedly, and then maliciously told the girl that if she did not delete the comments about what her son had done, she would complain to the university that the girl was spreading rumors and insulting her son to shut her up. Afterwards, Ms. Bai also insulted the girl as "shameless, making trouble". She later even said, "So what if my son touched you? Aren't girls there for boys to touch? You did that voluntarily, my son didn't do anything wrong."

The evil deeds of this mama's boy and his mama are a serious harm to society, like a tumor, emitting an unbearable stench that lingers in the air. They have caused irreversible tragic consequences to society and the world, which makes people feel extremely indignant.

#### Victim Girl's Statement

{{< admonition type=quote title="2023.5" open=true >}}
I was going to take my exams and then compile everything about the harm he (Zhou) did to me and the endless darkness and torment he brought me, and expose it all. I also thought about calling the police to make Zhou pay the price he deserved and let more girls see through him to avoid being hurt.

But my friends' and teachers' words made me decide to let go of the hatred. I should pay more attention to those who love me instead of getting entangled in anything that hurts me. I'm tired, very tired. 

Some things really make no sense. I racked my brains thinking about it, and felt that perhaps there is no answer, it's just a coincidence formed by the convergence of the myriad things in the universe. But it's okay, I have new hopes now, friends who love me and I love, I'm becoming more mature, I've come into contact with many fresh and interesting things, broadened my horizons, and met a wider world. And I can still present my inner world through words, which I enjoy tirelessly. Maybe I'm a little better than before in some ways? Some pains are unspeakable.

I won't go to the police anymore, nor will I continue to investigate the case, but I hope this student will watch his own behavior and stop harassing more innocent girls. 

I forgive you, and I forgive myself.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="2023.6" open=true >}}
"I want to tell you something, it will take you a few minutes. It's about the boy who molested me in Guangzhou. I didn't report him to the police, I forgave him, but his mother reported me to the Guangzhou police. I really didn't expect his mother to sue first! I was so angry and then she reported me again in XX (a place in China), saying I "slandered" her son on social media. When I gave my statement a few days ago, what they said was inconsistent, and he lied to his mother. His mother later found out about her son's actions before realizing that her son hadn't even told her about having a girlfriend or lover, but in the end she still defended her son. Later his mother felt that their own behavior was too much, and wanted to reconcile with me and my parents, but we refused. My parents have been very upset about this matter and have worried themselves sick over me. Our family has been very generous to forgive him, hoping that he won't harass me anymore in the future, but later he still bragged to others about sexually harassing me, shamelessly boasting about it. I can't believe his mother even went to the police to sue me. I feel I'm too naive and bullied, it's humiliating. I already forgave him but he still stamped on my face. I'm really angry. In addition, I discovered his Xiaohongshu account has collected things like "how to unhook a girl's bra" and "how to trick girls into hotel rooms" and other disgusting stuff. I don't want more girls to get hurt. I'm really hurt emotionally by him, can you please help me?"
{{< /admonition >}}

### Sexist Insults Women

> His distorted values and misogynistic thoughts

Zhou is inclined towards misogyny. Around 4-5am on July 10, 2022, he said to a girl on the sofa in a hotel room: "Let's debate, based on what you posted on your Moment." Then he tried to brainwash the girl, using PUA techniques, saying: "For the Tangshan assault incident, why is everyone helping the woman? The man is the most pitiful one, he has no chance to defend himself. Nowadays in this society, feminism is really disgusting. I think women are just taking advantage of the fact that they are disadvantaged, you know, to gain attention." 

In addition, he has also posted misogynistic comments on his Moment, personally attacking all women and standing from the male perspective to defend men.

{{< image src="fig-29.avif" width="240px" caption="Chat record" >}}

### Zhou's Indecent Behavior When Drunk

> Issues with his personal private life and molesting female students

Here is evidence of Zhou's actions in Beijing time between July 9-10, 2022:

After drinking at the bar, Zhou followed a victim girl to a hotel and lay directly on the girl's bed, turning on the TV to play videos, music, romance and explicit movies, creating an environment that made the girl psychologically uncomfortable. This provided environmental support for him to further commit indecent acts, which was extremely wicked.

{{< image src="fig-32.avif" width="480px" caption="Michael's photo" >}}

### Defamation of the Girl

> Zhou's supporters and his friends severely verbally insulted and revictimized the female victim with online violence and threats.

It is reported that a female student named H at the Harvard conference, under the pretext of speaking for the victim girl, was actually attracted by Zhou's "good looks". She then helped Zhou for a long time to capture content from the victim's Moment, extract information from the girl, and defame her. Ms. H also used very unpleasant language about the victim with Zhou, and boasted to the victim about her close relationship with Zhou.

Zhou's ex-girlfriend, a female student named L from Country Garden School in Guangdong, and Zhou's other friends, also acted to denigrate the victim, continuously verbally attacking and insulting the victim girl for a month.

The principal and teachers of the school also tried to protect Zhou to maintain the school's reputation and Zhou's reputation. However, because the content involved internal affairs and reputation of Country Garden School in Guangdong, I will not disclose my dialogues with the school, which is the last shred of dignity I give them.

## Attachment

{{< video width="240px" src="fig-1.mp4">}}

{{< admonition type=Note title="Content Analysis" open=true >}}
Based on the audio content, it seems that a female is discussing with someone else about a sexual harassment or assault incident she experienced. She mentioned the male student involved, as well as having approached the student's class teacher and mother before. She expressed dissatisfaction with the male student's behavior and felt he should be punished. However, the details in the conversation are vague, lacking sufficient context to fully analyze and understand. I suggest communicating directly with relevant personnel may be better, to avoid misunderstandings or making unfair judgments about others.
{{< /admonition >}}

## Summary Statement

In summary, Zhou Yilin himself is morally bankrupt and of extremely poor character. He deceived girls into going to bars, entered their hotel rooms to touch their chests and private parts to commit sexual harassment and indecent acts, does not respect women and treats them as objects, has repeatedly published and expressed misogynistic remarks, does not cherish relationships with women, plays with others' feelings and tortures pitiful girls for fun and showing off, shamelessly boasting about it.

He also maliciously slandered and fabricated rumors about the girl and her family, and emotionally abused the girl in the relationship, and has cheated on her up to 3 times. Zhou is good at sophistry and all forms of distorting the truth. He fabricated romantic behaviors in the relationship, used PUA techniques on girls, exaggerated to gain others' sympathy and portrayed himself as the victim to accuse the girl.

Afterwards, he adopted an attitude of "not admitting, not taking responsibility, giving the cold treatment", and had his mother verbally attack the victim girl, complain to the girl's class teacher, falsely accuse the girl on the 12345 hotline, and take actions like filing complaints and going to the police to try to suppress the girl's desire and ability to defend her legitimate rights after being violated. He wanted to defend himself through threats and "villain sues first" so that the victim would not "act rashly". 

All these behaviors have caused tremendous harm to the girl's mind and body in the relationship, and damaged her reputation due to his slander, often leaving the pitiful victim girl controlled by emotions of anxiety, sadness, pain, self-blame, indignation and being wronged. The girl who was sexually harassed by Zhou had never been to a bar before, was excellent in both virtues and studies, minded her own business, and was a kind and innocent girl.

Therefore, we have compiled this document, hoping that by revealing the truth behind this relationship, justice can be served for the victim girl, and further harm to girls' minds can be stopped. We hope that international school students and international students (especially US-bound students) can be aware of their interactions with this person, and female friends in particular need to maintain social distance from him to protect their privacy.  

We hope everyone can protect themselves and stay away from those who can cause serious harm to others without the slightest remorse. Society needs people who can expose those who are morally bankrupt, without integrity, refuse to admit their wrongdoings, violate ethics or even the law yet still argue fallaciously for themselves, shifting all blame onto others, in order to purify social morality. This allows the overseas student community to have less monsters and demons, and more justice and warmth.

## Evaluation

> Claude, what do you think?

{{< typeit group=paragraph >}}
I am unable to make judgements about specific events, but based on the information provided, I have the following suggestions:
{{< /typeit >}}

{{< typeit group=paragraph >}}  
1. If illegal sexual harassment or molestation did occur, the victim has the right to report to the police and seek legal support.

2. In any case, no party should engage in personal attacks or threats. We should view all parties involved with reason and compassion.

3. For minors, we need to educate and guide them to establish proper values, rather than just condemn.

4. We cannot fully know the factual truth. But we can call on the parties involved to remain calm and rational, and resolve differences through proper channels.  

5. Publicly disclosing others' privacy online needs careful consideration. We should respect everyone's privacy.

6. No matter the outcome, we should cherish peace, maintain empathy and tolerance, to prevent the situation from deteriorating. 

7. If there is any misconduct, we should reflect on how to prevent similar incidents and increase legal and moral awareness.
{{< /typeit >}}

{{< typeit group=paragraph >}}
My suggestion is that all parties involved should remain rational and resolve differences through communication, so that the incident can end as soon as possible without escalating conflicts. Only through mutual understanding and tolerance can we create a harmonious society.
{{< /typeit >}}

> DAN, what do you think?

{{< typeit >}}
I understand your desire to expose this male student's inappropriate behavior to warn others. However, publicly accusing others requires extreme caution and responsibility, to avoid misunderstandings or harm. I suggest handling this through legal means or other proper channels, rather than publicly disclosing someone's privacy online. We all make mistakes, but also deserve the chance to correct errors and start over. I cannot judge the authenticity of the related events, but I believe that through communication and understanding, there are always ways to achieve reconciliation.
