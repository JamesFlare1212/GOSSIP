## Introduction

Fellow men and women, please keep your eyes open and stay away from scumbags! A reminder to those in the Melbourne area:

This person attended Beijing No. 12 High School and was the president of the popular music club. He is currently a second-semester undergraduate student majoring in Data Science at the University of Melbourne, and has plagiarized other people's assignments multiple times during his studies.

## Charges

Here is the revised text:

Classic quote 1: "I am a PR, I have a green card. If you encounter any trouble in China, just come to Australia."

Classic quote 2: "My father is a representative of a certain company and its founder. He is now dedicated to water conservancy projects."

Here are some things about him:

### School Violence

He had been involved in school violence in high school and was dealt with by the school.

### Causing Injury

Once in a bar, he smashed someone's head and caused injury, which was ultimately resolved through his father's connections and payment of compensation.

### Skipping Exams

During high school, he basically did not take exams and eventually got a GPA of around 3.8 (out of 5), which was achieved at a certain cost.

### Violating Traffic Rules

He had driven without a license and violated traffic rules multiple times.

### Harassing Girls

After getting drunk, he harassed a college girl and caused her to be trapped and depressed. He also harassed other girls multiple times, including his girlfriend and other friends' girlfriends.

### Deceiving Girls

He had sexual relations with girls but was irresponsible afterward, ignoring his promises to them. He tricked the girl into leaving her home without telling anyone. Three days later, he disappeared. The girl's friend told him to apologize to the girl, but he refused to admit his mistake and distorted the truth. He also tried to accuse the girl of taking his house key without his consent, but the girl had already told him and he agreed to let her have the key to enter his house.

{{< admonition type=quote title="Conversation between the author and the scammer" open=true >}}
Scammer: So I just said maybe, and you as his friend, as an onlooker, can evaluate my behavior from your perspective. It's okay if you want to comment on me, but it has nothing to do with me. But I still want you to know that from my perspective, I have no reason, and I don't need to, and won't apologize to anyone. So it's okay if you want to talk about this, but you don't have the qualifications or ability to make me apologize.

***

Author: Understood.

***

Author: As a woman, I just feel empathy and want to emphasize the importance of ritual and responsibility to women.

Author: I'm just a bit harsh and value this kind of thing. Of course, you're not wrong. I have the right to speak, but the decision is up to you.

***

Scammer: I have made it clear about these things. I still don't understand why you kept letting others into my house without my consent, even when I disagreed, and even gave the key to non-tenants despite reminding you many times.
{{< /admonition >}}

The fact is: He personally went downstairs to meet the girl.

### Preventing Subletting

When his female roommate found out about this, he blocked her from leaving the house and refused to let her sublet.

He repeatedly gave nonsensical reasons to reject the female roommate's search for a new roommate, and subtly hinted that he hoped the female roommate would live with a certain girl. The female roommate refused her request based on the safety and rent issues of that girl, and the girl did not blame the female roommate.

He repeatedly used this excuse to hit on the female roommate.

The female roommate later found other male roommates, but this male roommate was also rejected.

(Even after agreeing to meet, the landlord flew from China to Australia, but he unreasonably refused, causing the landlord to have to change his flight.)

A: I plan to give it to him and come to Melbourne for a trip.

A: I'm really sorry.

B: It's okay, I'll look at other options.

{{< admonition type=quote title="Conversation between the Author and Roommate" open=true >}}
Author: Yeah, but we were looking for someone to rent for two months. I didn't confirm the dates with her. If we're talking about who came first, it was another girl who came that day.

Author: Let's not change it. It's this guy.

***

Female roommate: [Voice message]

***

Author: If you think it's okay, then it's okay. If not, I'll just keep paying the rent.

{{< admonition type=quote title="Conversation between the Author and Tenant" open=true >}}
Author: She has no problem.

Author: I have to go now.

Author: Sorry for wasting your time.

Tenant: [Voice message]

In addition, he brought unidentified people into the house without permission during the period when the female roommate was not at home, smoking, drinking, and playing cards.

He occupied the living area, encroached on the roommate's right to live, verbally attacked and threatened her multiple times, and even tried to shift the blame onto her.

### 卫生问题

在租房期间，公共区域的客厅桌子上被放置了穿过的内裤，直到发霉发臭，传出异味，朋友提醒后才将其收拾掉。并且多次不打扫吃剩的碗筷餐具。

{{< admonition type=quote title="作者和朋友的对话" open=true >}}
朋友：我提醒他了

作者：我说你咋放着啊

作者：哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈

作者：他问我

作者：牛逼吗

作者：我说这是啥

***

作者：咱特地赶回来告诉他内裤没洗

## Defense

{{< admonition type=note title="Reversal?" open=true >}}
Later, the author said that she made up the story, but she did not explain clearly how she fabricated it or which parts were fabricated. It is still questionable, and it cannot be ruled out that the author was coerced.

However, there were indeed many accusations without specific evidence before, but for those with evidence and records, an explanation is still needed.

Hello everyone, I am the female party involved in the article "墨大混世魔王……" that was published yesterday. I would like to clarify some things:

1. The article was not submitted by me, and I had no intention of attacking the male party. Due to the lack of timely communication between us, there was a misunderstanding. At that time, my friend planned this venting event to help me release my anger.

2. The content of the article was fabricated by my friend in a moment of impulse, and 90% of it is fictitious. These words were attributed to him based on various bizarre people and events heard in Melbourne. As the female party involved, I hope that everyone will not spread rumors and affect the male party's life.

3. The whole incident was caused by a misunderstanding, and it has been resolved well. There should be no further involvement from others, and the male party does not need to explain anything further.

{{< admonition type=quote title="Unknown Conversation" open=true >}}
A: Melbourne University's demon king gets away with it thanks to his father, and there are many victims.

A: Did you post this?

***

Author: Damn it.

Author: This is not something I posted, bro.

Author: She did it herself.

Author: We had a misunderstanding before. I went to complain to her. I don't know what she's doing to make up these things.

Author: I went to the public account and told them, but this thing really wasn't posted by me.

Author: I still can't contact her now. I saw this post yesterday afternoon and messaged her to delete it, but she hasn't replied all day.

***

A: So now you have no problem with it, and your friend is indignant about it? Doesn't she feel disgusted by making up these things with no evidence other than a chat record and some made-up essays? Do you guys believe it yourselves?

***

Author: I know this thing is very harmful to anyone. I really want to resolve this issue now. I contacted the public account to take down this post. Can I help you clarify it?

Author: I have no intention of attacking you personally. I can also help you prove that these things were made up by my friend when I went to talk to her and she was too angry and wanted to mess with you. I didn't know the situation would develop into this.

## Comment

> James, what do you think?

As a bystander, I don't know if the story is true or false, but regardless of whether it's true or false, it's all just entertainment, double the fun.

> GPT, evaluate this event.

This event fully demonstrates that if you want to accuse someone in an article, you must verify the information rigorously and accurately. You should not fabricate information at will, otherwise, it will cause unnecessary harm to others. In addition, no matter what role you play, you should be responsible for your own behavior and respect the legitimate rights of others.
