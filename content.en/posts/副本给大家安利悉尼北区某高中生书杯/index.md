I want to give some comments on a local Sydney high school student A. He appears harmless on the surface, but has done many improper things in private.

My friend L is gay and he doesn't mind people knowing it. But A went behind his back telling classmates that L liked sticking to him, which made him very uncomfortable. In fact, L is a rather introverted person. It was A who took the initiative to cling to L, while L just sat quietly next to him. What A said was slandering L.

Since they went to the same high school, A spread rumors among classmates that L was a "disgusting" gay who liked everyone he saw. This led to L being briefly ostracized when he first enrolled.

L has many female friends. A shamelessly went up to him and asked L to introduce girlfriends to him. Out of kindness, L did introduce some. But A not only didn't cherish them, he also cheated everywhere, thinking about girls in other "pots" while eating out of his own. He didn't even spare a 14-year-old girl. Fortunately, L found out in time and didn't give the girl's information to A. When A was in a relationship, he often looked around for other girls to flirt with.

A also arrogantly believed that everyone around him was stupid. He often made up rumors to slander others. His classmate C was a victim. C had done some silly teenage things as a joke that he didn't want to be made fun of, but A not only told everyone about it, but also made websites to humiliate C. C angrily confronted A, but A shirked responsibility. As a man who doesn't dare to admit when he does something wrong, he really deserves to be castrated. Later when they saw C was not to be trifled with, they spread rumors off campus, which led to many people who didn't know C gossiping about him for a while.

As time went by, A's reputation at school was also seen through by more and more students. One's public image cannot withstand the test of time, and few people wanted to hang out with him anymore. Girls should stay away from him when they encounter him. He is not a good person, stay away from this high school Teddy boy. These were some very childish matters that needn't be written out, but he had harassed too many people.

I hope that female students at school can keep their distance when they encounter him. He is no good, stay away from this high school Teddy boy. Feel free to supplement more details.

Friend, I notice your tone is very angry and negative when describing this high school student A's behaviors. However, we need to cautiously look at situations like this and avoid making unfair judgments.

Everyone makes mistakes, especially during adolescence. We don't know A's family background and upbringing. These may be the reasons for his behaviors. 

I suggest taking the following approaches:

1. Use empathy to understand A, but it doesn't mean agreeing with or supporting his wrongdoings.

2. Tell A directly but kindly that some of his behaviors are inappropriate and have hurt others. 

3. Encourage A to reflect on himself and correct his mistakes, to become a better person. We all deserve a second chance.

4. If A's behaviors seriously harm others, assistance can be sought from teachers or parents, but it should be done in a constructive rather than attacking manner.

5. Avoid retaliation, spreading negativity will only lead to more harm.

6. Focus on helping the victims like L and C, so they feel understood and supported.

Everyone is growing up and will make mistakes. What's important is the attitude, giving opportunities to correct mistakes rather than judging or attacking. This takes time and patience, but the outcome will be better. Please consider my suggestions.
