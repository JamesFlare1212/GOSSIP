## Introduction

Hello everyone, today we have a special program. Let's first take a look at today's protagonist.

This girl has presented herself as a white and rich lady on social media platforms such as Xiaohongshu and Instagram, making people feel that she is a spoiled little girl. However, her subsequent behavior is very confusing.

## Charge

To summarize, if you have ever hired a photographer or taken photos with a girl, you should know that the process of taking pictures usually involves 3 parts of photography and 7 parts of post-production. Throughout the process, the photographer will always cooperate with the girl's needs.

The total cost of the photography session was 400 dollars, but the girl only paid 50 dollars. Later, she claimed to have edited the photos herself on Taobao, but in reality, she used the photos that the photographer had edited (only color adjustments were needed). The girl did not pay the remaining 350 dollars.

Later, this incident sparked intense controversy on Xiaohongshu. Then, a new incident was revealed, and it turned out that this beautiful and wealthy young lady had already done this "dinner" behavior before.

{{< admonition type=quote title="Accusation by Xiaohongshu user Jarvis" open=true >}}
Sydney photographers, please be aware. Don't give out the negatives without receiving the final payment, like I did, because not everyone is trustworthy.

On the day of the shoot, I promised to deliver the photos within two weeks. She asked if I could do it faster, and I said I would try my best.

Then, last Tuesday, I finished taking graduation photos, uploaded the negatives for her to choose on Wednesday, color-corrected on Thursday, finished retouching on Tuesday, and was ready to deliver them to her today and receive the final payment.

As a result, she blocked me, leaving me confused. It turns out that there are really people who skip out on the bill and freeload. The Sydney circle is so small, why can't we be good people?

Am I right, Wang Zhengtai?

## Defense

> I feel that what you did was inappropriate. I have already paid the deposit but have decided not to proceed with the project. You violated my privacy by exposing our communication, do you realize that? I could sue you for that. You charged $400 just for adding a filter and adjusting the color, is that how you conduct your business? In such a small place like Sydney, you should not do business like this.

> I paid a $50 deposit to the photographer jarvisliu1108 (WeChat ID) on April 4th and planned to pay the remaining $350 after he finished the job. However, the photographer's efficiency was extremely slow, and I was still waiting for the photos. In the meantime, he even went to an electronic music festival in Melbourne, and the filters he used were very strange. In the end, I decided to give up working with him and paid an additional $50 for the labor cost to process the photos myself. However, the photographer demanded that I pay the remaining balance even though the work was not completed yet. He only adjusted the filters, and nothing else was done. When I offered to pay for the labor cost and process the photos myself, he did not even respond. I believe he is using coercion to demand payment, which is unethical. Moreover, he exposed me online, when in fact, his efficiency was too slow. It had been two weeks, and the color of the photos had not been adjusted properly. Such efficiency would have closed the business in China. Can't I decide to handle these photos myself? Isn't he violating my rights? Finally, this photographer seems difficult to communicate with, and his approach is very arbitrary. He even refused to modify the photos and demanded payment directly. I do not think this is reasonable behavior.

## 额外指控

{{< admonition type=quote title="Conversation between netizens and the author 1" open=true >}}
Netizen: Here's the situation. I previously rented a house with my roommate in Sydney for a year, and we paid the deposit. Due to the epidemic, I couldn't go back to Australia during the holidays, so my roommate helped me sublet my room through an agency. This girl signed the contract with her name on it. I don't remember when she started renting, but she moved out early within the contract period and didn't pay the remaining rent for the contract period, which amounted to more than 1,000 Australian dollars. The amount was deducted from my deposit.

{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="Conversation between netizen's roommate and Wang Zhengtai" open=true >}}
Netizen's roommate: You still need to pay two weeks of rent. That person moved in on the 1.8th.

Netizen's roommate: Originally, it was due on the 15th, but she moved in on the 8th because you weren't there.

Netizen's roommate: You can also pay one week less.

***

Wang Zhengtai: But she can pay whenever she moves in.

Wang Zhengtai: You can sign a new contract after she pays until the 15th.

***

Netizen's roommate: Yeah, she moved in on the 8th.

Netizen's roommate: She has her own place now.

Netizen's roommate: She said she would move in on the 15th.

Netizen's roommate: Because your lease ends on the 15th.

***

Wang Zhengtai: She can pay from the 8th to the 15th, and then you can sign a new contract with her.

***

Netizen's roommate: Yes, but you need to pay before that.

***

Wang Zhengtai: You can collect her rent from the 8th to the 15th, which won't affect anything.

***

Roommate of the netizen: I mean, you still have to pay the rent before the 8th.

Roommate of the netizen: After the 8th, I won't ask you for it anymore.

***

Wang Zhengtai: What about your previous roommate? Isn't she coming back to live with you? I see her luggage is still at home.

***

Roommate of the netizen: She wants to come back, but she's not sure. Before you moved in, she thought she could come back and kept paying rent until she couldn't find a roommate.

Roommate of the netizen: Because her contract still has half a year left.

Roommate of the netizen: If you move out before your contract ends, you still have to pay the rent. Otherwise, you can find someone to live with you for a few weeks, but the contract is under your name.

Roommate of the netizen: You definitely have to pay before the contract ends.

{{< admonition type=quote title="Conversation between netizens and the author 2" open=true >}}
Netizen: It should have been originally one month from 12.15 to 1.15, but later my roommate found her other friend to move in on January 8th. However, she did not pay the rent during the period from December 15th to January 8th, and deducted it from my deposit.

Netizen:

> Wang Zhengtai: I have moved out and no longer live there, and I didn't pay for it. I know the contract hasn't expired, but I don't want to pay for a house that I don't live in when I'm abroad. I only paid for the days I lived there.

Netizen: These are her exact words and her logic.

Netizen: The screenshots above are all conversations between my roommate and her.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition type=quote title="Conversation between netizens and Wang Zhengtai" open=true >}}
Wang Zhengtai: Type it out.

***

Netizen: We signed the contract together.

Netizen: I paid the deposit, but I didn't go back later.

Netizen: Now the landlord says there is rent missing.

***

Wang Zhengtai: I have nothing to do with this contract anymore.

***

Netizen: You need to make up for it.

***

Wang Zhengtai: I can't.

***

Netizen: Then you need to make up for the missing rent, sis.

Netizen: Hey, are you there? That Wang Zhengtai guy rented a house from me and my roommate before, but he didn't pay the rent for the last month and left the room dirty and smelly. I can show you the screenshots.

***

Netizen: She left and the carpet was all dirty. I had to find someone to clean it.

Netizen: She even claimed to have cleaned the carpet, but she didn't.

Netizen: Terrible.

## Comment

> James, what do you think?

I think this matter can be big or small, compared to other cases, it's not that bad. However, it's still a bit unethical and caused economic losses to others. According to the amount, it is considered a more serious crime in our country. Everyone should treat it with a reasonable attitude.

> GPT, evaluate Wang Zhengtai.

{{< typeit >}}
As an AI language model, I cannot evaluate personal behavior. However, we should all respect the agreements and transactions between photographers or any other service providers. If the agreement is to pay the full amount, then we should respect the agreement and do as agreed. Dishonest behavior cannot achieve a harmonious social atmosphere.
