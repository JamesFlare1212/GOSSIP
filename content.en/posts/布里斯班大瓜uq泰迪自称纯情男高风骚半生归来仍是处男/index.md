## Introduction

He left China to study in Australia's Queensland through intermediaries due to his school's poor reputation in Shenzhen. Ladies in Shenzhen and Australia, beware of this scammer Pete Wei!

## Charge

Introduction of the protagonist: Pete Wei

{{< image src="fig-1.avif" width="320px" caption="Pete Wei" >}}

I met Pete Wei on April 18, 2022, when he asked for my WeChat account and started harassing me frequently by messaging me.

{{< image src="fig-2.avif" width="240px" caption="Harassing messages" >}}

Since we went to the same school and the number of people was not that many, a lot of rumors started circulating when he added me.

{{< image src="fig-3.avif" width="240px" caption="Rumor 1" >}}
{{< image src="fig-4.avif" width="240px" caption="Rumor 2" >}}

I heard a lot of rumors about him, but he tried to make me believe that he was sincere by having classmates say nice things about him and even writing me small essays every few days to express his deep and pure emotions.

{{< image src="fig-5.avif" width="240px" caption="Emotional" >}}
{{< image src="fig-6.avif" width="240px" caption="Pure" >}}

At that time, I was foolish enough to believe him, and after talking for a few months, we became a couple. However, shortly after we started dating, he started suggesting sex frequently and repeatedly.

Even when we were on dates and I sat right next to him, he still tried to fish on Xiao Hong Shu (a social media app).

{{< image src="fig-7.avif" width="240px" caption="Fishing post" >}}
{{< image src="fig-8.avif" width="240px" caption="Xiao Hong Shu homepage" >}}
{{< image src="fig-9.avif" width="480px" caption="Fishing on Xiao Hong Shu" >}}

He loved fishing so much that it was like how humans need to breathe air every second and minute.

{{< image src="fig-10.avif" width="240px" caption="Fishing comment 1" >}}
{{< image src="fig-11.avif" width="240px" caption="Fishing comment 2" >}}
{{< image src="fig-12.avif" width="240px" caption="Fishing comment 3" >}}

Before he went abroad, he had already engaged in some unsavory activities on Xiao Hong Shu. Moreover, during our relationship, he never mentioned his social activities on Xiao Hong Shu to me. It wasn't until after we broke up that I accidentally discovered his Xiao Hong Shu account.

{{< image src="fig-13.avif" width="240px" caption="Xiao Hong Shu search" >}}

And during our relationship, he had several "deep conversations" with "friends" he met on Xiao Hong Shu. Through his homepage, I added one of his girlfriends.

{{< image src="fig-14.avif" width="240px" caption="Conversation with Xiao Hong Shu girlfriend 1" >}}

During the days when we were cold-shouldering each other, he was not idle.

{{< image src="fig-15.avif" width="240px" caption="Conversation with Xiao Hong Shu girlfriend 2" >}}

Even after telling me he was going to sleep, he continued to talk to his girlfriend on the phone.

{{< image src="fig-16.avif" width="240px" caption="Conversation with Xiao Hong Shu girlfriend 3" >}}
{{< image src="fig-17.avif" width="240px" caption="Conversation with Xiao Hong Shu girlfriend 4" >}}
{{< image src="fig-18.avif" width="240px" caption="Conversation with Xiao Hong Shu girlfriend 5" >}}
{{< image src="fig-19.avif" width="240px" caption="Conversation with Xiao Hong Shu girlfriend 6" >}}

After arriving in Australia for just over a month, he started online dating. He found one girl not enough and started chatting with many others, which made him feel overwhelmed.

{{< image src="fig-20.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with online girlfriend 7" >}}

{{< image src="fig-21.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with online girlfriend 1" >}}
{{< image src="fig-22.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with online girlfriend 2" >}}

Just like a teddy dog that pees everywhere, during our relationship, he did many things that left me speechless. First, he often boasted but rarely followed through.

{{< image src="fig-23.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with me 1" >}}
{{< image src="fig-24.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with me 2" >}}
{{< image src="fig-25.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with me 3" >}}

These are just some of them, there are many, many more.

{{< image src="fig-26.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with online girlfriend 3" >}}

Afterwards, he texted me "520" (I love you) and said he bought me a gift.

{{< image src="fig-27.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with me 4" >}}
{{< image src="fig-28.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with me 5" >}}
{{< image src="fig-29.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with me 6" >}}

In the afternoon, he called me and proposed to buy me a pair of Yeezy shoes. I thought maybe he felt he had given me too little money and wanted to make it up to me.

{{< image src="fig-30.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with me 7" >}}
{{< image src="fig-31.avif" width="240px" caption="Chatting with me 8" >}}

However, he never intended to buy me shoes and instead asked me if I wanted a much more expensive pair of shoes such as LV or Balenciaga. Later, when I mistakenly thought he had bought me shoes, he asked me to buy him headphones instead. Without hesitation, I placed an order, but he never actually bought me shoes. It wasn't until much later, when he couldn't let go of his face, that he finally bought a pair on the resale market. I even found a link to a "micro-business" website on his phone. He also posted photos of his ex-girlfriend on his social media account. After I requested a breakup, he kept apologizing and asking for reconciliation. He continued to pester me, even when I blocked his main account, his secondary account kept sending messages asking for forgiveness. I chose to compromise and give in time and time again.

Without my knowledge, he called other girls baby, and I choose to keep some dignity for this person.

{{< image src="fig-32.avif" width="240px" caption="Wei's Moments" >}}

The value I brought him during our relationship was:

{{< image src="fig-33.avif" width="240px" caption="Wei's Conversation with the author 9" >}}
{{< image src="fig-34.avif" width="240px" caption="Wei's Conversation with the author 10" >}}
{{< image src="fig-35.avif" width="240px" caption="Wei's Conversation with the author 11" >}}
{{< image src="fig-36.avif" width="240px" caption="Wei's Conversation with the author 12" >}}
{{< image src="fig-37.avif" width="240px" caption="Wei's Conversation with the author 13" >}}

After all that I had experienced, all I wanted from him was to take an attitude that was sincere, and to apologize to me and the women he had hurt. However, he behaved as if he had done nothing wrong. Since he couldn't even do such a simple thing, I had to end the relationship completely.

{{< image src="fig-38.avif" width="240px" caption="Wei's Conversation with the author 14" >}}

I wrote so much just to let everyone take a good look and to help Australian and Shenzhen sisters avoid such scams. I hope that when looking for a man, everyone can keep their eyes open and not be fooled like me.

You can see this and laugh.

Supplementary explanation:

1. Despite my repeated requests for a breakup, he continued to entangle himself with me and flirt with other women. He even accused me of fishing when other men added me as a friend.

2. Afterward, he frequently told lies and would say one moment he was at a bar, and the next that he needed to go to sleep, making it very difficult to trust him. I had asked to see his phone and WeChat before, and he had agreed. He even allowed me to check it after he returned to China. However, one time, out of boredom, I logged into his WeChat and he began to get angry, claiming that group messages and messages from his mother were very important. He also mentioned that the money in his WeChat wallet and Australian dollars in his bank account would be blocked if the system detected that there was an unauthorized login, making me suspicious of his true intentions.

3. In the seconds right after he had bought me shoes, he asked me to buy him a jacket and a bag. Something funny happened once when we made a bet and he said that whoever lost would transfer 200 yuan to the other person. After I transferred the money to him, he not only didn't receive it but also claimed that he was saving it for when we went out to play.

4. During our time together, apart from occasionally giving me flowers and the pair of shoes he bought me after pleading, he hardly ever gave me any gifts. We went shopping together before, and he asked for my opinion on skincare products, and said it was good after I recommended it. Then he said he would buy it, but in the end, it was me who paid for it, while he stood aside with the salesperson looking at him. Later, he pulled me to look at the perfume, claiming to buy it for me. After I negotiated with the salesperson, he directly opened the app of DW which is where I paid. After I refused, he opened his own app of DW. (Later, in order to balance things out, I gifted him a similar perfume as a present.) There was another time when he was shopping for a power bank, and he asked for my help, but he found out the model he picked was wrong at the cashier. I ran back to change the model for him, but then he just said, "Then you pay for it." The scope of our dating activities was always based in the area between his neighborhood and mine. One time, I suggested going to another district to play, but he refused and said he was afraid of bumping into his ex-girlfriend.

5. In high school, he harassed several female students in our class with both words and actions, and even asked for SM photos from them. He also harassed female students from other schools through friends, online, and even on club outings, and attempted to develop certain relationships. When I asked him about it, he tried to shift the blame and deny it, saying that someone in senior year deliberately set him up. Before I joined the same club as him, he repeatedly asked me to delete the WeChat account of the club's president. After I joined his position in the club, he repeatedly asked me to quit. I don't know how to say it, but if you're just a bored, unattended dog, why not take you to the park to smell the smell of sausage, why not taunt more female dogs on the street? Can't you find other ways when you need to pee and scratch yourself? If you see a female kangaroo on the side of the road, are you so irresistible as falling in love with someone? You really behave like a male dog, and you just want to pee everywhere when you see a woman, but you'll never change even if you love eating feces.

{{< image src="fig-41.avif" width="240px" caption="Pete Wei's chat log 2" >}}
{{< image src="fig-42.avif" width="240px" caption="Pete Wei's chat log 3" >}}
{{< image src="fig-43.avif" width="240px" caption="Pete Wei's chat log 4" >}}
{{< image src="fig-44.avif" width="240px" caption="Pete Wei's chat log 5" >}}
{{< image src="fig-45.avif" width="240px" caption="Pete Wei's chat log 6" >}}

He always talks about confusing things, which makes people suspect that he has some mental issues. His behavior and speech patterns make people think he might suffer from some paranoid disorder, and he often tells weird stories to others. In our school, he once stated that a girl always wants to have sex with him, calling himself the most handsome pre-university student, and frequently claimed that girls were staring at him when he was outside. He's an extraordinary person among the ordinary. Last time I spoke to him on the phone, he suddenly said, "You know, I'm popular with girls everywhere I go." I was very confused, I didn't know who gave him such great confidence. He also got angry with his ex-girlfriend and insulted her in various ways. I wonder how he will insult me now in case we break up.
