## Preface

What is GuaTian Neo? What about the original LXSGuaTian?

The owner of LXSGuaTian has decided to quit, here is his statement:

> ### I'm tired, I'm not doing this anymore.  
>   
> When I started this website, I hadn't read a single pdf, I just wanted to make a website for fun to share gossip with my friends.
>   
> Getting over a million views in less than a week changed everything.
>   
> The past few days can be simply summarized as being pushed around by various things - friends who wanted to develop the site together, people who wanted me to promote it, those who wanted to help me figure out operations, people who wanted to contribute, invest, and those who were very enthusiastic about helping me out with ideas, to the point where I didn't have time to truly think about what this site was really doing.
>   
> The nature of this site meant that during the process of rapid growth, the "gossip" had no guarantee of authenticity, and the huge traffic inevitably brought unnecessary harm to both the exposed and the exposers. Up until now, more than 10 people have wanted their pdfs taken down due to distress caused by the site. 
>   
> Even if the site could really grow into a stable forum with decent traffic in the future, I really can't accept growth driven by exploiting people's voyeuristic desires and exposing major gossip events. The entire site was gradually deviating far from my own values as traffic increased.
>   
> Therefore, after the secondary reconstruction of the site was basically completed, and the comment and like functions were added and ready to launch, I still decided to permanently close down LXSGuaTian. The community of over 2,000 people I had built will also dissolve tonight, and the advertising revenue, which was the only monetization attempt, has been fully refunded. I apologize to anyone who may have been hurt.

I was working on reconstructing the site, so I launched the original fork.  

### GuaTian Neo

[**GuaTian Neo**](https://neo.schoolmelon.com/) is a fork of LXSGuaTian. It is lighter, cleaner, and open sources all code and engineering files. We have rewritten, or are rewriting, the contributed content to achieve a better reading experience.

{{< admonition type=success title="Alpha" open=true >}}
Currently, [**GuaTian Neo**](https://neo.schoolmelon.com/) is undergoing grayscale testing and collecting feedback.

## Vision

This website aims to cultivate the public's critical thinking skills and promote cognitive development across different social strata by collecting and analyzing timely sociological case studies.

For the general public, we specially select cases that reflect contemporary social realities, and train readers to explore the essence behind phenomena and develop independent thinking on social issues by providing multi-perspective analysis.

For academic researchers, we gather a large number of cutting-edge cases that have not yet received widespread scholarly attention. These timely first-hand materials can enrich empirical research and broaden academic horizons.

For international students, considering their dual cultural backgrounds, our cases cover East-West societal discussions, aiming to enhance international students' cross-cultural analytical abilities and critical thinking. This will improve their academic competitiveness and employment advantages.

For the Internet, we are committed to building a rational and inclusive discussion platform, providing perspectives not yet in the mainstream, to enrich online content, balance the current public opinion ecosystem, and promote the healthy development of the Internet.

We uphold rational and progressive values, are not biased towards any ideology, and welcome rational discussion and exchange based on the cases from all walks of life.

## Improvements

We have rewritten most of the content from <u>[LXSGuaTian](https://www.lxsguatian.com/)</u> and made improvements, optimizing the reading experience. We have also re-presented the content in the screenshots in text form for universality. 

For some images, we used generative AI to enhance the quality and improve the viewing experience.

For the text, we used generative AI to polish, rewrite, and split the original content, including formatting errors caused by copying. 

For the content, we open sourced all code and documents. If interested, you can even deploy your own clone locally. See the end for details.

For performance, we used the lightweight static [FixIt](https://github.com/hugo-fixit/FixIt) theme with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) architecture for extremely high performance.

## Limitations

We have extremely limited verification of authenticity, and can only rely on rapid version control to promptly correct issues. Therefore, there is a risk of malicious exploitation, such as retaliation.

Ethically, it is still controversial whether public moral trials are acceptable to society, and there are potential legal risks.

The sample size is limited, and since the goal is not to be a database, the functionality of "avoiding pits" is completely unrealistic.

## Join Us

You can contribute in several ways - correcting errors and improving content.

### Submit Improvements 

Our code is hosted on GitHub. 

<a href="https://github.com/JamesFlare1212/GOSSIP/">
  <img src="https://github-readme-stats.jamesflare.com/api/pin/?username=JamesFlare1212&repo=GOSSIP&theme=github_dark_dimmed&show_owner=true" alt="GOSSIP Git Card">
</a>

If you want to submit changes, please submit them as a [Pull Request](https://github.com/JamesFlare1212/GOSSIP/pulls) for branch merging instead of trying to commit directly to the main branch.

### Correct Errors

To correct errors, you need to submit an [Issue](https://github.com/JamesFlare1212/GOSSIP/issues) in this project's repository. 

I encourage you to fully discuss in the [Issues](https://github.com/JamesFlare1212/GOSSIP/issues) before submitting a **PR** ([**P**ull **R**equest](https://github.com/JamesFlare1212/GOSSIP/pulls)).

If you have been maliciously slandered, do not worry. We do not tolerate this behavior, and we also have an obligation and responsibility to remove false information from the platform.

### Improve Content

If you want to propose new ideas, I recommend you start a [Discussion](https://github.com/JamesFlare1212/GOSSIP/discussions) and then discuss, rather than submitting an [Issue](https://github.com/JamesFlare1212/GOSSIP/issues), because that is an improvement rather than an error. 

If you have good content or know of high quality sources, feel free to contribute.

### Contribute

If you don't have the ability or time to directly rewrite a post like this, but only have similar PDFs or relevant links that you still want to analyze and contribute, you can do so too. But sending files might be a hassle, so try uploading them somewhere and sending the link instead. You can also directly send attachments via email.

You can also join the [Telegram group](https://t.me/schoolmelon) to contribute.

### Form 

If you just have some ideas and don't want in-depth discussions, you can provide feedback directly via this form.

## Collaboration 

You can contact us at jamesflare@schoolmelon.com. Please describe the collaboration content, and briefly introduce the project if possible.

You can also contact us on Telegram ([@JamesFlareV2](https://t.me/JamesFlareV2)).
