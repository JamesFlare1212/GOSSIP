## Introduction

{{< image src="/site-logo.avif" width="240px" caption="If this image is displayed normally, then you do not need to worry." >}}

You may have noticed that images are not displayed on Edge browser. This is because Edge browser does not yet support the AVIF image format. It is recommended that you use a different browser, any browser that is relatively new should work.

## What is AVIF?

AVIF is a new image format that has been spreading for almost two years. It can greatly reduce the size of images, resulting in not only saving space but also faster loading speeds.

In my actual tests, reducing the size of PNG images by 90% is a common occurrence.

## What are the issues with Edge?

I don't know why Edge doesn't support AVIF even after two years, especially since it uses the same Chromium kernel as Chrome. Chrome and Safari both support it, and even Firefox supports it, but Edge still does not.

Moreover, Edge can play videos encoded with AV1, so I don't know why it doesn't support AVIF, which is also part of the AV1 encoding.

## Why do I insist on using AVIF?

I personally have a passion for web pages and hope to use the most advanced technology and the most advanced formats, even if there is a little incompatibility. Even bilibili has started using AVIF, but not as radical as I am.

Considering that most overseas students use relatively new technologies, I won't change it. If you really cannot accept such a radical strategy, feel free to leave a comment or feedback. Thank you.

## Why do I need to update my browser?

One reason is that browsers often have security vulnerabilities, so updating is always a good idea.

Secondly, browsers often have very good features, such as Chrome's recent automatic Tab Sleep feature, which can save a lot of memory, so why not?

Lastly, there are also compatibility issues. Technologies like AVIF that can really benefit people depend on all of us to popularize them, don't they?
