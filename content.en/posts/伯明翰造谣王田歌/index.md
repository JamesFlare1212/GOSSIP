## Charge

It seems that this lady born in 1993 cannot stand seeing others doing well. She often posts other people's photos in her moments. Is it because she is not good-looking and steals other people's photos? In addition, she openly declares that she wants to mess with others, spreading rumors about female students, which is really hard to say. Since she entered Kaplan Preparatory School and then the Education Department in Birmingham, she has insulted many victims, and even publicly exposed various personal privacy such as photos, home addresses, and phone numbers.

Let me tell you how I got involved with this lady: my friend asked me about her because she was very famous in the group before (I will attach specific chat records later). I advised my friend to be careful and not get too close to her. Somehow, my WeChat account and TikTok account were leaked to her, and she harassed me for a whole semester. After scolding me, she often changed her profile picture and WeChat account, and shared my photos and videos as invitations to go out for hot pot. She even took screenshots of my TikTok videos that I didn't allow downloading and shared them. What makes me even more disgusted is that she posted a group photo of me and my family on her moments, and then publicly exposed us on the Internet. In addition, she also publicly exposed the home addresses of me and my classmates on Xiaohongshu, which really made me very disgusted. After a while, she stopped, and I thought I could avoid her and enjoy Christmas, but she started spreading rumors that I and my classmates were engaged in prostitution again. After seeing the screenshots my friend sent me, I was really angry. I never thought there would be such shameless people!

## Conclusion

Finally, I want to say that this woman really gives the impression that her thinking or spirit is a bit problematic. I sincerely suggest that she see a doctor, after all, she spent so much money coming here and cannot be left with nothing, while also having psychological problems. Secondly, I want to say that justice is in the hearts of the people, and thank my friends for their continued support. Please rest assured that I will not spread rumors and slander others like you do. The time spent arguing with you is better spent comfortably lying in bed and getting a good night's sleep. Please do not bother me and my classmates anymore. I released this PDF not only to clarify the facts but also to remind others to avoid people like you. I hope you take care of yourself.
