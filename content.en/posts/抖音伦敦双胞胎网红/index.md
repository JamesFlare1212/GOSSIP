## Charge

During the time I stayed at their house, I bought a B&O A9 speaker and four or five bottles of whiskey with a vintage. However, Qin Ziyue's brother posted my belongings on his Moments and social media without permission. At first, I didn't care about it, but he told a girl, "He's taking apart my speaker. This speaker is his own." I had told Qin Ziyue about this and said that there was no need to bring it up with his brother. I thought it was just a small matter. However, his brother's exact words were, "This is my house," "I can post whatever I want on my Moments."

It wasn't until the incident of borrowing clothes that Qin Ziyue actively approached me to borrow clothes, claiming that he wanted to take graduation photos. After confirming several times that it was only him, it turned out that his brother also came, and they each took a set of Dior suits. His brother also borrowed a Dior brooch. After taking graduation photos, they didn't return the clothes promptly. When I went to get my clothes back, I found one of the white suits casually thrown in the closet with a hanger nearby, but it wasn't hung up. This showed that they didn't cherish clothes that didn't belong to them. I found that there were foundation marks all over the collar and asked his brother to take it to the dry cleaners. He agreed, but after two days, the clothes were still not cleaned. He wore my white suit again without my knowledge and posted photos on various social media platforms. I had specifically loaned the white suit to Qin Ziyue and did not agree for his brother to wear it.

For several days, I was worried and almost had my brooch damaged, but SA helped me repair it. In the end, I had to spend my own money to have the clothes dry cleaned, but there were two obvious stains on the clothes that couldn't be removed. The price of this piece of clothing is 39,000 RMB, yet they have never proposed any form of compensation.

I believe that many of you have seen the traces of someone wearing this white suit without my permission on various social media platforms.

Before, I talked to someone about audio equipment and clothes. I thought we were friends, but later I realized that I was wrong. Although we can make fun of each other, I have never said anything negative. However, this matter later reached Qin Ziyue's ears. Although I admitted that I had talked to someone else about audio equipment and clothes, he began to accuse and verbally abuse me, and even threatened to make me feel the power of capital. I have never used swear words or strong emotions in my language.

Regarding Qin Ziyue's claim that I skipped him and went drinking with his girlfriend A, I didn't think it over carefully. At first, I invited Qin Ziyue and his girlfriend to come drinking together, but since Qin Ziyue doesn't drink, I changed my words and directly invited his girlfriend. It wasn't for any other purpose, I just wanted to have enough people, and they weren't alone in a closed space. I think I didn't think it through in this regard, and I apologized to Qin Ziyue afterwards. I think I made a mistake in this matter. However, there is one more thing I want to mention, that is, A sometimes invites me to go out for a drink, and I even asked Qin Ziyue if he agreed.

{{< image src="fig-15.avif" width="240px" caption="Chat record 3" >}}

Furthermore, Qin Ziyue never admitted to me that the girl was his girlfriend, and he kept me in their house just to drive her away. He always referred to that girl as "Pink Hair".

Regarding Qin Ziyue's claim that I smoked and dirtied his house's floors, and demanded that I compensate him for a whole set of furniture, and sued me for breaking into his residence, I would like to clarify the following points:

1. First of all, it was your brother who voluntarily left me in your house, and your common goal was to drive away a girl, not me breaking into your residence.

2. At the same time, that girl often smoked at home, how can you confirm that only my smoking left traces?

3. When I smoked, I had already received your consent, and I only smoked on the balcony. You mentioned that the intermediary conducted a house inspection, and because of the presence of smoke, most of our rental deposit was deducted. Even in the absence of any evidence, I still paid you a deposit of 5,000 pounds. So, when will you transfer the money for my clothes compensation to my account?

Finally, after receiving my deposit, you still insulted me. Your family education really made me smile.

Because my accommodation check-in was delayed, Qin Ziyue offered to let me stay at his place, and I stayed there for about a week. I was very grateful and offered to pay for a month or half a month's rent, but Qin Ziyue insisted that I didn't have to. I could afford daily expenses, so I paid for everything, including takeout meals. Every time we ordered food, at least four people ate, and everyone knew that takeaway prices in London were not cheap. I drank £2,000 worth of alcohol at his place, and Qin Ziyue himself doesn't drink, but his girlfriend, brother, and several girls his brother brought home do. Because I was staying at his place, I felt like I should take the initiative to handle this expense.

On the second night of my stay, my phone was stolen, and I was very grateful for Qin Ziyue's brother accompanying me to look for it. We didn't get back home until very late, and I've always kept this in mind. But apart from these two things, I didn't receive any other help from them. If I'm wrong, please point it out. But I don't think it's necessary to always emphasize that they took care of me and say that I don't know how to be grateful before I receive further help from them.

## Easter egg

I met Qin Ziyue in early 2021. The first time we met, I went to Shanghai to see him, and I paid for a massage while he treated me to a plate of pan-fried buns. Apart from that, there were no other expenses. The second time I went to Dalian to see him, I spent 2,000 yuan treating him to drinks, and he said that there was no need to return the favor in the future, that was enough, and we didn't have any other expenses after that.

Before I came to London, I asked Qin Ziyue if he needed me to bring anything for him, and he directly bought the things that took up half of my largest suitcase and had them sent to my house. I also paid for some of the medicine expenses, which I didn't question as a friend.

I don't want to bring up many small things, but you keep talking about me outside. You are Qin Ziyue's friend, I treated you to Japanese food and drinks, and when you told me that no one gave her a gift on holidays, I immediately ordered a bouquet from Wild Beast Flower and had someone deliver it to her. I only met this girl once, and we didn't have any relationship, we didn't even chat or have any ambiguous relationship. As Qin Ziyue's friend, I have fulfilled my duty.

I have been talking about myself, and I don't want to care about the rumors outside. Everyone is an adult, and if there is a problem, we should be brave enough to face it. Now you have disappeared and are slandering me behind my back. I just want your apology and for Qin Ziyue to compensate me for the cost of my clothes.

## Comment

> GPT, evaluate Qin Ziyue based on this passage.

{{< typeit >}}
Based on this description, Qin Ziyue's behavior is quite irresponsible. His brother's behavior of stealing other people's belongings and wearing other people's clothes without permission is very disrespectful. When Qin Ziyue borrowed clothes, he did not properly store or return them, and even caused damage to the clothes, but did not compensate, which is very unethical. In addition, Qin Ziyue spreading untrue rumors and slandering others' images is also unacceptable. In short, Qin Ziyue's behavior lacks basic moral standards and sense of responsibility. He needs to reflect on his words and actions and apologize and compensate to the injured party.
