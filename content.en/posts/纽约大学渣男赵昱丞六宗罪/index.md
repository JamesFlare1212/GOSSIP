## Charge

### Secretly filming girls in black stockings

On the evening of September 15, 2022, Zhao Yucheng (Andrew), who had a girlfriend and did not believe in Christianity, attended a dinner at the New York University Christian Church and secretly filmed a stranger's black stockings. He later uploaded the video and photos to a group with over 100 members called "Pan-Pacific International Military Tribunal". The group members gathered together to fantasize about the girl in the black stockings, using insulting and objectifying language such as "200 dollars to rip it off", "suck it", "love to wear black stockings, little sister~~" and so on. After the dinner, Zhao Yucheng continued to follow the girl to the subway station, constantly updating her video in the group. Finally, he obtained the girl's WeChat and shared it with the members of the group. The members of the group were all male students from the 26/25/24th grades of New York University. The group name has been changed several times because of the obscene comments against women in the group, and the group has been shut down several times.

On that day, Zhao Yucheng was wearing his girlfriend's Parsons school uniform and wearing her hair tie. He took out his phone and secretly filmed the black stockings of a girl in front of him while everyone at the New York University Christian Church was reading the Bible, disregarding the feelings of his girlfriend and the privacy of the stranger. After being exposed, he changed his name to 26 CAS Yang Jiechi, and in some groups, his account name was changed from "command_ps" to "contra_wind" to avoid attention.

{{< /admonition >}}

According to the report, Andrew Zhao Yucheng spread malicious rumors with several friends without his girlfriend's knowledge, including false rumors about their relationship and details of their interactions, as well as comments accusing his girlfriend, such as "Zhao Yucheng treats this girl like a dog," "The girl not only controls him, but also spreads rumors about Zhao Yucheng," "The girl physically assaulted and injured Zhao Yucheng with a kitchen knife," "Zhao Yucheng's life was severely affected," "After breaking up, the girl's family members harassed and morally blackmailed him," and so on. All of these comments are false and completely contrary to the facts.

The girlfriend was shocked and angered by all the groundless and malicious rumors. It was revealed that on March 7, 2023, Zhao Yucheng forcefully closed the door, trapping his girlfriend's fingers and causing serious bleeding, bruising, and suspected bone fractures. He had to take time off to go to the hospital for X-rays (with photos of his injured hand and medical records attached). On April 11, 2023, Zhao Yucheng beat his girlfriend for about ten minutes in their room and took away her phone, preventing her from communicating with friends. He even covered her mouth and nose with his hand, attempting to suffocate her, while she begged for mercy (with photos of her injuries and chat records with friends asking for help attached). On April 16, 2023, during an argument, Zhao Yucheng slammed his girlfriend's head against the wall, causing her to suffer a minor concussion, and prevented her from seeking help from her roommates and neighbors.

All of the descriptions provided by Zhao Yucheng and his friends are extremely absurd and completely contrary to the facts. The girlfriend's family has always respected the relationship between Zhao Yucheng and the girlfriend and has never interfered excessively. The girlfriend's family does not have Zhao Yucheng's contact information, and there is no moral blackmail or harassment from the girlfriend's family.

### Deception, Recidivism, and Verbal Abuse

The romantic relationship between Zhao Yucheng and his girlfriend began on July 26, 2022, during which he repeatedly deceived her and showed no signs of improvement. Two weeks after they started dating, Zhao's friend invited him to go clubbing, but he deceived his girlfriend and took her to play mahjong instead. Four weeks into the relationship, Zhao played Texas Hold'em with his friends but deceived his girlfriend, claiming they were just having dinner as friends.

On November 13, 2022, Zhao Yucheng chatted with a female student from New York University Shanghai and had a suspected ambiguous relationship. Zhao Yucheng made multiple late-night calls to the female student, complaining that his girlfriend was abusing him (which was not true). His girlfriend repeatedly asked him to delete the ambiguous female student, but Zhao Yucheng added her back and continued to deceive his girlfriend.

When his girlfriend found out and confronted him, Zhao Yucheng became emotional and verbally abused her and her friends, saying things like "Who do you think you are? You're a mentally ill person who doesn't deserve to live. Being with you is like going to hell" and "You'll die sooner or later." The above statements are all from real-life conversations and are not accompanied by photos or chat records. I take full responsibility for all the content mentioned above.

### Bad habits and behavior affecting social norms

Zhao Yucheng has a very low moral bottom line. On September 10, 2022, despite knowing that he had tested positive for antigens, he still ignored the risk of indirect transmission and the health of others, and went out to have dinner and play with many friends, spending a long time in a closed space with many people.

In the incident, Zhao Yucheng did not believe in Christianity, and his participation in the church dinner organized by the school was purely for free food. Before attending the party, he told his girlfriend, "I'm going to have a free dinner." However, he secretly filmed a girl in black stockings while many people were reading the Bible in the Christian church. This shows that Zhao Yucheng does not respect others' religious beliefs and personal privacy. He used other people's photos to satisfy his and his friends' perverse tendencies and desires, and also hurt his girlfriend, who was kept in the dark throughout the whole process.

Contrary to the image of a wealthy and handsome second-generation overseas student portrayed by Zhao Yucheng's friends, he is actually vain and pursues luxury brand purchases, but all his clothes are replicas. Similarly, from Zhao Yucheng's behavior of freeloading, it can be seen that he is not the wealthy son described by his friends.

{{< image src="fig-18.avif" width="240px" caption="Chat record screenshot 2" >}}
{{< /admonition >}}

In the early morning of May 6, 2023, Zhao Yucheng posted false details of his love affair with a girl on his WeChat Moment, while blocking the girl. Due to the image he had created for himself, his friends sympathized with him and even felt indignation, trying to plan verbal abuse. The above is partial chat record evidence.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Zhao Yucheng's behavior is morally corrupt and of extremely poor character. He does not respect women and views them as objects. He does not cherish his emotional connections with women, and has committed violent acts against them. He has also maliciously slandered and fabricated rumors about the women and their families. Zhao Yucheng has twisted the truth and fabricated romantic behavior between the two parties, and accused the women from the victim's perspective. This has caused great harm to the women's physical and mental health, as well as their reputation.

Therefore, we have compiled this document, hoping that international students can be aware of this person's behavior. Female friends, in particular, need to be cautious and maintain social distance from him to protect their privacy. We hope that this document can reveal the truth behind this relationship and remind everyone to be cautious when making friends, and not to be deceived by appearance and behavior.

## Comment

> James, what do you think?

I think this matter is relatively minor compared to other cases. At most, it is a matter of personal conduct, and it is not appropriate to conduct moral trials. However, causing harm to others is a more serious matter, but it is not a serious crime under existing laws. It is unethical, but not to the extent that everyone despises him. Everyone should look at it rationally.

> GPT, evaluate Zhao Yucheng.

{{< typeit >}}
Based on the behavior and events presented, Zhao Yucheng's behavior is clearly extremely unethical and unacceptable, including acts of theft, malicious rumors, and physical violence. These behaviors involve violations and harm to others, especially objectification and violence against women, which are serious violations of social ethics and laws. Zhao Yucheng's actions have caused irreversible harm to others and should be punished and warned accordingly.
