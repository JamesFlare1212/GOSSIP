## Save Data Summary

I once met a 19-year-old UQ commerce student who turned out to be a scumbag in a WeChat group. After chatting for a while, we went out a few times, and after pursuing her for three weeks, we did many things that couples do.

However, the good times didn't last long, as the scumbag girl broke up with me. The next day, I noticed a strawberry mark on her neck, and after asking her, I found out that she had already been with a boyfriend in the student apartment (Scape Merivale) before I met her. Both the Scape-limited boyfriend and I knew each other, and we both thought we were just friends of the scumbag girl. After a confrontation among the three of us, the scumbag girl denied anything that had happened between us, and even though I wanted to tell the truth and reconcile with her, she had already apologized and swore. In order to avoid escalation, I made concessions.

However, through a friend's WeChat, I found out that this scumbag girl was calling me a disgusting old man in her WeChat Moments. This scumbag girl is a time management master, and below are some timelines and related evidence.

## Timeline

### 3.17 First Meeting

I met her on March 17th in a group chat where we were selling cigarettes. She lived in Scape Merivale. As I was passing by, I decided to deliver the cigarettes to her. On that day, I had already seen that she had a designated boyfriend, but I was not sure about their specific relationship. After delivering the cigarettes, we chatted briefly and agreed to go out together on Sunday.

### 3.19 First Date

On March 19th, we went out for the first time, and we spent a long time outside. During that time, she did not refuse some physical contact, such as letting me touch her hand when she praised her friend's soft hands while driving. In the evening, we went to Mount Coot-tha, and she hugged my shoulder on the mountain. One of our friends took a candid photo of us. Afterwards, when we went out together, we occasionally held hands.

### 3.22 Confession

On March 22nd, after having dinner with her and our friends, I confessed to her in the car, but was rejected. However, at this time, her reason for rejection did not mention having a boyfriend or liking someone else, but rather that she did not know me well enough and did not say that I had no chance. The following is our chat record after we got home.

### 3.24

She actually knew about my need for a sense of security, but did not refuse to meet me or physical contact. I arrogantly drove her to and from class and even taught her how to do her homework in business courses. The following picture is a panoramic photo of us.

### March 26 - The first time she came to my house for dinner

I picked her up in the evening and invited her to dinner at my place. While we were smoking downstairs, I used her phone to take a photo of us together. After dinner, she posted the photo on her WeChat Moment.

### March 27 - Testing her opinion of me

Because she mentioned wanting to eat Ferrero Rocher chocolates during our dinner the night before, I secretly prepared them while we were shopping in the afternoon to surprise her. Below is our chat record, where I asked her about her opinion of me. At this time, she repeatedly referred to Scape's limited boyfriend as her friend and had used that term to address him before. I found it strange that they were just opposite-sex friends, but spent the whole day together, and I even cooked for her and helped her with laundry. However, I didn't think much of it, maybe they were just good friends.

### April 1 - The second time she came to my house for dinner

After dinner at my place, she suggested going out for a walk. So I suggested taking her to Shorncliffe Pier, where I took some photos for her. Since it was quite cold by the sea, I lent her my jacket. We walked barefoot on the beach holding hands, and after we finished, I helped her wash her feet. When she stood on a higher spot, I said I would carry her down, and she jumped into my arms.

Some unimportant meetings were omitted in between.

### 4.11 Confirming the relationship (Key Point)

That day, we went to the Gold Coast together, and after returning in the evening, I took her to my house. Then, I confessed to her again, and this time she agreed to be with me. Because we had intimate contact during the confession, she got excited and touched me through my pants, saying that she felt particularly excited on the table.

But I didn't want to do that, so I took her to my bed. Below is a photo taken by a passerby on the beach that day.

### 4.14

There was nothing special about this day, but it's worth mentioning that after we finished eating hot pot, she rushed back to cook for her Scape exclusive boyfriend.

### 4.19

Because I couldn't stand the feeling of being hot and cold all the time the day before, I wanted to talk to her downstairs in the apartment building and see if there was any chance for us to salvage the relationship. However, I found a strawberry mark on her neck. So I asked her what was going on, and she said it was from a friend. I further asked her if she was with the Scape exclusive boyfriend, and she replied that she was not.

### 4.21 Early morning

The more I thought about it, the angrier I got, and I couldn't stand it anymore. I wanted to talk to her about it. After she apologized downstairs in her apartment building, I thought the matter should end there. But unexpectedly, while driving home on M3, the Scape exclusive boyfriend called me and started insulting me with foul language, which made me very angry. I got off the highway and drove back to Scape Merivale. I waited there for two hours, but this man didn't dare to come out and talk to me, and even threatened to call the police.

### April 22, early morning

I was so angry that I drove to Scape Merivale and planned to have a good talk with the designated boyfriend of Scape. I managed to obtain his phone number through some means, and I didn't want to involve the issue between that woman and me.

Later, I found out that she had already been with that man before I met her. Both parties did not know about each other's relationship with her. The man thought I was just her friend, while I thought the man was her friend.

The recording was very long, and I put the transcript of the recording in the bottom left corner of the original article. If you have the patience, you can take a look. The scumbag woman denied the facts that had already happened frantically, and finally, the key point broke through her defense and she slammed the door and left.

To make matters worse, after breaking through her defense, this woman also posted a WeChat Moment cursing someone just because someone exposed the truth and accused her of being disgusting, while she was the one who was truly disgusting.

## Summary

Since I met this scumbag woman a month ago, she has always claimed that Scape's designated boyfriend is her friend. The result is that she has a boyfriend in the apartment and another boyfriend outside, and she can perfectly balance the two and manage her time accurately. She can spend a whole day playing with her outside boyfriend, or she can stay in the room with her boyfriend in the apartment all day

## Comment

> GPT, evaluate this event.

{{< typeit >}}
This is a highly unethical event. The woman involved was dating two men and was able to perfectly balance her time between them. This behavior not only betrayed the emotions of the two men but also challenged moral standards. She even denied the truth when confronted and eventually cursed others on her WeChat Moment, which is unforgivable and extremely repulsive.
