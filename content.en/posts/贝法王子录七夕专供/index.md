{{< /admonition >}}

## Introduction

This article is dedicated to reminding the little prince of Beifa:

{{< center-quote >}}
False pretenses will collapse,
Boasting will eventually backfire.
A virgin can't pretend forever,
Emotional debts and financial debts must be paid back.

Those who do wrong will perish by their own hand,
Those who seek redemption can turn back from evil.

## Narrative

In July of the Year of the Tiger, with peach blossom shadows falling and the blue sea tides rising, a missing person notice appeared in the BT2 dormitory group of Queen's University, and the landlord was looking for a tenant. The reason was that this person had broken the appointment and disappeared with property. This person was none other than the notorious Beifa Prince, whose behavior had caused great harm and pain to many students. The fermentation of the incident attracted more and more students to join the crusade. Gradually, the clear information revealed a series of despicable and dirty events.

As we all know, Beifa Prince is a second-generation wealthy man who uses deception and speculation to gain wealth, which is also the reason for his notorious reputation. This book records several typical stories in chronological order to show Beifa Prince's unethical behavior. The entire recording is titled "Beifa Prince Record - The Lost HONG Third Generation Wealthy Second Generation in Britain".

## The Missing Prince

> After damaging the house, the prince disappeared. The landlord searched everywhere but to no avail, so he had to seek help in the BT2 dormitory group, which unexpectedly led to other troubles...it's a long story.

### The missing prince, urgent search but no results

The prince left without paying the electricity bill, damaged the floor and furniture, took away three or two pillows, refused to communicate, and blocked the landlord.

{{< image src="fig-1.avif" width="480px" caption="BT2 dormitory group" >}}

### In ancient times, Meng Mu moved three times, why did the prince run away?

Was he tormented by G5 and had to destroy his living environment to relieve stress? What kind of grievances led to the destruction of this luxurious house?!

{{< image src="fig-2.avif" width="480px" caption="BT2 dormitory group" >}}

### The prince fled in a hurry, leaving behind a mess

As the saying goes, a room full of garbage is a delicacy, and the nobles have no shame. He left chaos in the room and disappeared without a trace.

{{< image src="fig-3.avif" width="640px" caption="Messy dormitory" >}}

## The Mystery of the Prince's Background

> The prince's family background is not simple, with a billionaire mansion in the military,
> 
> Excellent academic performance and light law, both in business and military.

### The Prince's Rich and Luxurious Life as a Second-Generation Rich

With three billion yuan in his bank account, easily earning millions in cryptocurrency, and a wide social network, the prince scares away his "timid" roommates.

{{< image src="fig-4.avif" width="480px" caption="BT2 Dormitory Group" >}}

### The Prince's Charming and Suave Personality, Afraid of Being Burdened by Love

Everyone loves the prince, but he is suffering in silence, except for the persecution he received from BT2.

{{< image src="fig-5.avif" width="480px" caption="BT2 Dormitory Group" >}}

### Why Does the Prince Act Like a Baby Every Day? Could It Be That He's a Giant Baby?

{{< image src="fig-6.avif" width="480px" caption="WeChat conversation" >}}

### The Prince Wasn't Born to Royalty? He's Just Another Second-Generation Rich with Three Billion in Idle Money

> His parents are just normal company employees living in Danyang. They have some idle money to spend on him. But it's also possible that he could have inflated his own wealth to make himself look like the richest person in the universe.

His background is so ordinary?!
I don't believe it!
I don't believe it!
I don't believe it!

{{< image src="fig-7.avif" width="240px" caption="WeChat conversation" >}}

He owes 30 yuan?
Isn't this the gender-swapped version of KCL London Princess?
It doesn't match the prince's worth!

## Jack of all trades, master of none

> Wangzi said that as long as he was given a few bullets, he could solve a few people. He had fought against thugs and smashed J cars with his bare hands... When he met JC, it was just a casual chat between brothers. Moreover, he was a top student and could cook well.

### Military background, killing people like weeds

In daily life, blowing and dreaming, understanding the spirit of freeloaders. Both black and white roads are family slaves, who can stop Wangzi's bravery?

{{< image src="fig-8.avif" width="320px" caption="WeChat conversation" >}}

### Here we go again? A series of lies

Bravery is truly brave, but falsehood is also truly false.

{{< image src="fig-9.avif" width="240px" caption="WeChat conversation" >}}

Is it okay to beat people in the police car? This is considered the supreme right in our country.

> Speaking of the incident at Suda, it had a bad impact. Let me tell you another story. During my birthday party, he pretended to be drunk and made inappropriate remarks to my girlfriend. We decided to let it go since it was my birthday. However, he accidentally tripped himself while pretending to be drunk and left a long but shallow blood mark on his abdomen that didn't break the skin. The next day, he exposed it to the teacher and claimed that he had fought with a robber and got this "medal". He also said that he couldn't fight, but he gets excited when he sees blood and wants to beat people to death.

A blood mark caused by a bump became a "medal" left by Wangzi when he fought with robbers?! One word - absurd!

### Wangzi often makes strange noises, disturbing the people around him

So they reported him to the police and Wangzi just laughed it off.

{{< image src="fig-10.avif" width="640px" caption="WeChat conversation" >}}

At 1:30 in the morning, the police came to hang out. The argument is simply unbelievable. Are all the neighbors above, below, and diagonally deaf?

### A Top Student or a Mediocre Student? Exam Results are the Best Evidence

Don't ask about the future with fake academic achievements, because the answer is 29. Who doesn't know 29 in the world?

{{< image src="fig-11.avif" width="240px" caption="WeChat conversation" >}}

Boasting about education? Blaming Soochow University?

{{< image src="fig-12.avif" width="240px" caption="WeChat conversation" >}}

According to friends around him, Prince Wei has claimed to have received a graduate offer from a G5 university. It is really impressive to get a graduate offer before the start of the third year. Although it is not in line with the normal process, there have been such talents. The author has contacted the admissions department of the G5 university to confirm this. However, looking at that score of 29, it is really questionable...

### "I Cook All the Food!"

Prince Wei claimed that he cooks great food, but... would you dare to eat it?

{{< image src="fig-13.avif" width="640px" caption="Remains 1" >}}
{{< image src="fig-14.avif" width="480px" caption="Remains 2" >}}
{{< image src="fig-15.avif" width="240px" caption="WeChat conversation" >}}

### How Dare You Expose Prince Wei?

{{< image src="fig-16.avif" width="640px" caption="Exposure" >}}

Full marks in academics, full marks in skills, loves to set rules... can't do anything, but boasting is number one.

## Tricks for Girls

> Prince Wei has a trick for love, sweet words and portraits.
> 
> Spend a woman's money on clothes and food, showing off bad women.

### The Master of Flirting, with Unique Tricks

### Adolescent Girls Can't Escape the Word "Scam"

I spent a lot of effort and even had to buy a frame and a copycat on Taobao...

### Flaunting Wealth with High Acting Skills, Flirting Relies on Deception, No Money Left, and a Hypocritical Image

### The Wild Boar Everywhere Shows Mercy, Seeks Revenge When Rejected

Fortunately, he couldn't stay and all that was left was live streaming in Room 6.

{{< image src="fig-23.avif" width="640px" caption="Charge 1" >}}

### Love Proposal Artwork by the Prince

{{< image src="fig-24.avif" width="480px" caption="Artwork" >}}

The female protagonist has a high hairline? This painting skill is really not good.

{{< center-quote >}}
If I can't marry you in this life, I'll be a bastard turtle!  
Oh no, add one more egg, bastard turtle prince! - Jin Yong
{{< /center-quote >}}

### Slandering ex-girlfriends, despicable and shameless

All those who harm me are women, and all those who sting me are mosquitoes. Please think about it!

{{< image src="fig-25.avif" width="840px" caption="Artwork" >}}

### Pretending to be a virgin and newlyweds every time, are you tired, Your Highness?

I am not a virgin anymore. Will girls dislike me in the future? Oh my god, a virgin doesn't have such courage. Are all women seducing me?

{{< image src="fig-26.avif" width="640px" caption="Charge" >}}

## Passport Accident

> In the eyes of my ex-girlfriend, I'm a thorn, and her passport was hidden at home.
> 
> The police came to my shabby house three times, and I was speechless.

{{< center-quote >}}
This is called a woman's cunning. She left her passport behind to keep me.  
Prince's heart was ready to break up, no more love in the pavilion.  
Unfortunately, the woman saw the failure, and threatened the Prince to meet again.  
Prince's heart was already sick, and his phone was silent and disconnected.  
The woman chased after him relentlessly, and the police came to ask why.  
How could the Prince be threatened? Unfortunately, his English was as bad as shit.  
The police searched and arrested him several times without any new words.  
The woman had to solve the problem herself, and the Prince was released from prison.
{{< /center-quote >}}

{{< image src="fig-27.avif" width="240px" caption="Charge" >}}

It has been confirmed that on April 7th, Little Prince asked for help from many friends because the police came to his door because of a passport. Little Prince said that his (ex-)girlfriend pretended to break up, but left her passport at his place, possibly to increase her bargaining power when they meet again. However, Little Prince did not want to reconcile, so his girlfriend tore her face and called the police. Little Prince revealed that he had been threatened, but no one knows the specific situation. However, the police have visited his home three times.

Little Prince's poor English was neither understandable nor explainable. The police reprimanded him and said, "Be a man!" "Be a man!" He was almost taken back to the police station.

The (ex-)girlfriend had to rush to the scene to resolve the situation under pressure, and Little Prince was released.

### Criticizing the Ex-girlfriend, Prince Innocently Framed

## Comment

> GPT, evaluate this event.

{{< typeit >}}
This event involves a notorious Prince who breached a contract and disappeared with property, causing great harm and pain to many students. The immoral behavior of the Prince is gradually revealed through a series of disgusting stories, and these actions should be condemned. At the same time, the reason for the girlfriend's report to the police is also worthy of reflection. She resorted to threats in order to keep the Prince, which is not correct behavior. In addition, the Prince's poor spoken English has caused him trouble, reminding us to learn spoken English seriously to avoid being unable to explain clearly in emergencies. In short, this event shows the harmful behavior of a rich second generation to others, and reminds us to be moral and cultured people.
