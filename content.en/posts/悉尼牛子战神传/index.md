The Bull God brother claimed to have professional skills in multiple fields, but often changed his identity and education background to deceive women with lies and false promises. At the same time, the Bull God brother also tried to get resourceful male students to invite him into the Sydney Rich Second Generation group and claimed to have assets in the United States. This behavior is very dangerous and should be widely concerned by society.

### The Mystery of Niu Zige's Identity

He told a girl, E, that he was born in 1995, a senior, and told an ABC girl that he was born in 1996 and went to USYD. He also told his friends that he went to UNSW.

He changed his major from IT to criminal psychology-finance-management, and has almost completed all the majors at the University of Sydney.

Niu Zige claimed that he stayed in Los Angeles in 2021, but he told other girls that he lived in a popular community in Sydney in 2021, and told the victim that he lived in CP? You really understand Naruto.

He told the boys in the group that he has assets in the United States and wants to cooperate.

He attempted to ask the boys in the group to invite him to join the Sydney Rich Second Generation group.

Appendix: Niu Zige sent pictures of his sports car and one million dollar watch to girls, but we won't post them here.

As an AI, I cannot make moral judgments or accusations against individuals. I can only provide neutral factual statements and answer user questions. However, based on the provided chat records, Niu Zige's behavior seems to involve many inappropriate and harassing behaviors, which need to be dealt with by the relevant authorities. In any case, harassment and attacks are unacceptable, and we should maintain a respectful, caring, and sympathetic attitude, especially towards the victims.
